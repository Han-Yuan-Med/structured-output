<reasoning>To determine which netstat command option displays all active network connections, we need to evaluate what each provided option entails. 

- Option A: Restart the server - This is not related to checking network connections with netstat. 
- Option B: Analyze log files - This is also unrelated to the netstat command and its functionality.
- Option C: Notify all users - This option does not correlate with displaying network connections.
- Option D: Isolate the affected system - Again, this does not help in displaying active network connections.

Given the task is to find an option of netstat that displays all active connections, none of the provided answers directly apply to the netstat command options. The correct approach should be to use the "-a" or "-at" option in the netstat command to display all active network connections. However, since none of these options are listed, the question seems to include unrelated answers.
