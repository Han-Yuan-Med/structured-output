<reasoning>When troubleshooting network issues, the primary goal is to identify the root cause of the problem so that it can be addressed effectively. Here’s the reasoning for each action:

A: Restart the server - This action can be helpful because it can resolve issues related to temporary glitches or cache problems. While it might not identify the root cause, it can sometimes fix the issue temporarily.

B: Analyze log files - This action is critical for diagnosing network issues. Log files contain detailed information about the server’s operations and can provide insights into what went wrong.

C: Notify all users - This action doesn’t help in identifying the root cause. While it is essential for communication and managing user expectations, it does not contribute to troubleshooting the actual problem.

D: Isolate the affected system - This action is crucial for diagnosing issues, as it helps ensure that the problem is confined to a specific part of the network. It can also prevent the issue from spreading and affecting other parts of the network.

Therefore, the action least likely to help find the root cause is notifying all users, as it does not provide any diagnostic information.</reasoning>

When dealing with high network latency, it is important to first understand and diagnose the root cause to avoid unnecessary disruptions. The correct steps to take would be:

1. Begin by analyzing log files. This step can help identify any unusual activity, errors, or patterns that may be causing the high latency. Log files provide a wealth of information about the network's operational state, user activity, and possible issues and are crucial for diagnosing problems (B: Analyze log files).
2. If the logs indicate a specific system is the source of the problem, the next step should be to isolate the affected system to prevent the issue from spreading and affecting other parts of the network. This helps to maintain network stability while allowing detailed analysis and resolution of the issue in the isolated system (D: Isolate the affected system).
3. Restarting the server should be done only if it's determined that such action could directly resolve the issue indicated by the log files. This is usually a less precise method and could lead to data loss or other unintended consequences (A: Restart the server).
4. Notifying all users might be necessary if an outage or significant maintenance is planned, but it does not contribute to the diagnosis or immediate solution of the problem (C: Notify all users).

Based on these steps, the primary and most appropriate action to start with is to analyze the log files.
