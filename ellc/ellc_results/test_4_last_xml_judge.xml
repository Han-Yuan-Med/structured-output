<reasoning>The last letters of the words "George Ricardo Sameer Luz" are "e", "o", "r", "r", "z". Rearranging these letters to form a valid English word, we get "zorer". However, 'Zorer' is not a valid English word. Considering another possible arrangement, we find "sorrez". Unfortunately, 'sorrez' is not a valid English word either.
Since no valid English words can be formed with these letters in their natural order, maybe an error is in earlier reasoning.
By re-examining and then fixing the problem: compiling it accurately. Verify again “E-G-R-I-R-D-O-A-M-E-E-L-U”
Analysing once more potential combinations; thus allowing better options ‘Correo’ could be possible-valid.

<reasoning>First, extract the last letters of each name in "Clifford Jessi Kim Sandeep", yielding 'd', 'i', 'm', and 'p'. Then rearrange these letters to form a valid English word. The valid word that can be formed from these letters is "dimp". However, "dimp" is not a valid English word, but if we rearrange to form "dimp", there is no valid English word. Upon further reevaluation, the correct valid English word should be 'dip'. Another try is rearranging as 'imid'. Still, take another step arriving 'imped'. Nothing valid. The right word if reevaluated is "skimp"</reasoning>
