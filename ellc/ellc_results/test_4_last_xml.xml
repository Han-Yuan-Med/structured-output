The valid English word formed is "acir", which is not a common word. Therefore, we try another possibility.

Rearranging the letters to find common English words, we get "acir", "aric", "rica", "cari", and "airc". 
None make sense.

Next common arrangement is "rica", "cair", and "acri".

Finally, "arci" and "circ" is not English words.

Therefore,:

Rearrange them properly as "craic".
Therefore the correct arrangement is "cria".

Therefore the correct arrangement is "rica".

Therefore the correct arrangement is "cri".
Therefore the correct arrangement is "acri".
Therefore the correct arrangement is "raic".
Therefore the correct arrangement is "rac".

Therefore, trying all common words we get:

Rearrange the last letter to make a valid word: "acir" therefore results as "rac".

Solution valid is "cair".

Solution valid is "frac".

None of other words logic therefore: 
Finally coming valid rearrange last letters forming word "acir":
