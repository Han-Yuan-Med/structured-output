- Dustin: n

- Lex: x

So we have the letters n, x, x, and x. 

Next, we need to form a valid English word using these letters exactly once. 

Given that the letters are n and x (with x repeated three times), we recognize that forming a meaningful English word with these specific letters is implausible because 'x' doesn't generally blend well with other letters in common English words in this majority. Thus, there might have been an error or misunderstanding regarding the letters to be picked. Typically, English word formation requires related or diverse set of letters. Solving correctly would be impossible with x repeated.
