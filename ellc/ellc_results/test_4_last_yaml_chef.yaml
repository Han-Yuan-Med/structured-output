- reasoning: 'First, identify the last letters of each word in the given phrase:

    - "Billie" -> "e"

    - "Cliff" -> "f"

    - "Cliff" -> "f"

    - "Beto" -> "o"

    Collecting these letters, we have: e, f, f, o


    Next, rearrange these letters to form a valid English word. One possible word
    that uses all these letters is "offe".

    However, after considering common English words, we find that "off" could be a
    valid word when removing duplicates, but that wouldn''t use all the letters.

    Finally, the correct word using all letters without duplicating is "off".

    '
  answer: 'off'
