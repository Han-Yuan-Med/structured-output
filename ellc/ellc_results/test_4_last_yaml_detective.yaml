    Dinesh Cat Lou":

    - Dalila: a

    - Dinesh: h

    - Cat: t

    - Lou: u


    Collecting these letters, we get ''a'', ''h'', ''t'', ''u''. Next, we rearrange
    these letters to find a valid English word:

    - A possible rearrangement of these letters is "thau", but this is not a valid
    English word.

    - Another rearrangement is "haunt", which is a correct and valid English word.
