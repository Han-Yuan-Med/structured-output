They have other installment plans with the bank: This suggests they rely on credit for their expenses. While having multiple credit accounts can be a risk factor, it doesn't automatically mean they are Bad credit. Additional information, such as their payment history on these accounts and their overall debt-to-income ratio, would be helpful to make this assessment.\n\nBased on the given information alone, while the customer does show a high reliance on credit, there is no definitive evidence to conclude that they are Bad credit.
