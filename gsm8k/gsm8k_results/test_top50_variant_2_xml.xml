<reasoning>To solve this, we start by determining the quantity of white fabric needed. Since the garment requires half the quantity of white fabric compared to blue fabric:
Quantity of white fabric needed = 1 bolt (since half of 2 bolts of blue fabric is 1 bolt).

Next, we calculate the total bolts of fabric needed by adding the bolts of blue fabric and white fabric:
Total bolts of fabric needed = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white).

Therefore, the total number of bolts of fabric needed to make the garment is 3 bolts.</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, we calculate the house's total initial cost which is the purchase price plus renovation costs: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
Next, to find the new value of the house after the renovations, we increase the total initial cost by 150%. 
150% of $130,000 is 1.5 * $130,000 = $195,000.
We then add this increase to the initial cost to find the new value: $130,000 + $195,000 = $325,000.
Lastly, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total initial cost from the new house value: $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000.</reasoning>

<reasoning>To solve this, first calculate the total daily feed required for 20 chickens. Each chicken needs 3 cups per day, so 20 chickens need 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed each day. 

Now, add up the cups given in the morning and afternoon:
Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed provided: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Subtract the total feed provided from the total daily required feed:
Total daily required feed: 60 cups
Feed already provided: 40 cups
Remaining feed needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups

Thus, Wendi needs to provide 20 cups of feed during the last meal of the day.</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, calculate the price of one glass which is $5. The second glass is 40% off, costing 60% of the original price: 60% of $5 is $3. Therefore, for every two glasses Kylar buys, he spends $5 + $3 = $8. Since Kylar intends to buy 16 glasses, we can determine the cost as follows: 16 glasses divided by 2 is 8 pairs. Each pair costs $8, so 8 pairs will cost 8 * $8 = $64.

Thus, the total amount Kylar will spend is $64.</reasoning>

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the time Carla initially spends in downloading 40% of the file:
0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Since her download speed is 2 GB per minute, the time to download 80 GB is:
80 GB / 2 GB per minute = 40 minutes

Next, we add the 20 minutes required for the computer to install updates:
40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (updates) = 60 minutes

After the update, Carla starts downloading the file from scratch, which is 200 GB. The time to download the entire file again is:
200 GB / 2 GB per minute = 100 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes Carla to finish downloading the file is:
60 minutes (time spent before restart) + 100 minutes (time to download the entire file again) = 160 minutes

<reasoning>Alex drives for 3 hours at a steady speed of 60 miles per hour. This means he covers a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 3 hours = 180 miles

On his return journey, he drives for 4 hours in total:
1. He is caught in stationary traffic for the first 2 hours: 0 miles
2. He drives at 30 miles per hour for the next 30 minutes (0.5 hours):
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 miles/hour x 0.5 hours = 15 miles
3. He drives at a speed of 80 miles per hour for the remaining time, which is:
Remaining time = 4 hours - 2 hours (stationary traffic) - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
Distance = Speed x Time = 80 miles/hour x 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Total distance covered during the return journey:
0 miles (stationary) + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

Since Alex traveled 180 miles away from home initially and only returned 135 miles, he is:
Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered during return
Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, we calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
$10/hour * 40 hours = $400.

Next, we calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. She works 45 hours in total, so the overtime is:
45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours.

For the 5 overtime hours, she earns 1.2 times her regular rate:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour.

Then we calculate the earnings for the 5 overtime hours:
$12/hour * 5 hours = $60.

Additionally, Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes, each dozen priced at $55.
Hence, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is 6 * 55 = $330.

First, calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
Revenue per year = 7 lemons * $1.5/lemons = $10.50

Next, calculate the annual costs:
Annual costs = $3 (watering and fertilizing)

Then, calculate the net profit per year by subtracting the annual costs from the annual revenue:
Annual net profit = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

Now, calculate the number of years needed to cover the initial planting cost:
Initial planting cost = $90
Years to cover the cost = $90 / $7.50 = 12

Therefore, Carlos will start to make a profit after 12 years.

<reasoning>Carmen is left with 5 cleaning machines after selling at three residences. Let's denote the initial number of cleaning machines as x.

1. At the green residence, she sold one-third of her stock: 
   She sold (1/3)x, so she had (2/3)x machines remaining.
   
2. At the red residence, she sold 2 machines:
   Remaining stock was (2/3)x - 2.
   
3. At the orange residence, she sold half of the remaining machines:
   She sold (1/2)((2/3)x - 2), leaving her with the remaining half.
   So, remaining after selling half was:
   (1/2)((2/3)x - 2).

Since she is left with 5 cleaning machines, we set up the equation:
   (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5.

Solving for x:
   (2/3)x - 2 = 10,
   (2/3)x = 12,
   x = 12 * (3/2),
   x = 18.

So Carmen initially had 18 cleaning machines.</reasoning>

20 - 4 = 16 attendees.

Now, calculate the number of students who signed up for jazz dance:

Subtract the attendees who signed up for jazz dance from the remaining number of attendees:
16 - 4 = 12 attendees.

Electronic Gadgets Increase = $8000 * (1.2 / 100) = $96
Total value of electronic gadgets after one month = $8000 + $96 = $8096

To achieve an average pace of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12 miles, the total time it should take is:

Since he has already used 2 hours, the remaining time he has is:

After losing one liter of the orange beverage, the remaining amount of beverage is:

Now, calculate the amount of water in the remaining orange beverage:

Let the number of sticky notes in the purchased pack be X.
Total initial sticky notes = 80 + X.

Next, calculate the total sticky notes used: 
Total used notes = Total initial sticky notes - Remaining sticky notes.
220 = (80 + X) - 23.

Rearranging the equation to find X:
220 = 80 + X - 23,
220 = 57 + X,
X = 220 - 57,
X = 163.

So, the purchased pack contained 163 sticky notes.</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, determine the number of blue ties James purchased. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on them, he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties. Given James purchased twice the number of red ties compared to blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties. The price of each red tie is 50% higher than the blue ties, thus 40 + (0.5 * 40) = $60 for each red tie. Therefore, the cost for the red ties is 10 * 60 = $600. Finally, add the expenditure on blue ties and red ties to find the total expenditure: $200 + $600 = $800.</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, convert the total length of wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, multiply 4 by 12 to get the total length in inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Next, divide the total length in inches by the length of each segment:
48 inches / 6 inches/segment = 8 segments.

So, Tracy divided the wire into 8 segments.</reasoning>

First, find the total number of apartments in the building by multiplying the number of stories by the number of apartments per story:
15 stories * 8 apartments per story = 120 apartments.

Next, calculate the number of filled apartments by taking 75% of the total apartments:
75% of 120 = 0.75 * 120 = 90 apartments.

Finally, subtract the number of filled apartments from the total number of apartments to find the number of vacant apartments:
120 apartments - 90 apartments filled = 30 vacant apartments.
