    and uses 4 eggs for baking cakes. This totals up to 3 + 4 = 7 eggs used daily.

    Therefore, the number of eggs left for sale is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs each day.

    He sells these leftover eggs at the local market for $2 per egg.

    3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.

    He jogs a total of 60 miles each week. To find his running speed in miles per
    hour, we use the formula:

    speed = total distance / total time.

    So his running speed is:

    speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour."

  answer: '10'
- reasoning: 'Dana''s skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.

    Therefore, Dana''s running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

    Dana''s walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.


    Dana dedicates one-third of six hours to running:

    Running time = 6 / 3 = 2 hours.

    Distance covered while running = 2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles.


    Dana dedicates the remaining two-thirds of six hours to walking:

    Walking time = 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours.

    Distance covered while walking = 4 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles.


    Total distance covered = Distance while running + Distance while walking = 12
    miles + 6 miles.

- reasoning: 'Robin''s usual throwing range for the spear is 400 feet. With the emerald
    gem, he can throw the spear three times further. This means his new throwing range
    is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet. The dragon''s fiery breath has a reach of 1000 feet. The
    maximum distance outside the dragon''s flame reach from which Robin could stand
    and still strike Zargon with the golden spear is the difference between Robin''s
    throwing range and the dragon''s flame reach, which is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

- reasoning: 'Mrs. Anderson prepared 5 cherry pies, and each pie was sliced into 8
    portions.

    First, calculate the total number of pie portions:

    5 pies * 8 portions per pie = 40 portions.

    Next, use the fact that 14 portions were left uneaten.

    To find the portions consumed, subtract the uneaten portions from the total portions:

    40 total portions - 14 uneaten portions = 26 portions consumed.

    '
  answer: '26'
- reasoning: 'First, calculate the remaining calories you can consume today:

    Remaining calories = Daily caloric limit - Calories already ingested

    Remaining calories = 2000 - 1800

    Remaining calories = 200


    Next, determine how many servings of snack chips fit within the remaining caloric
    limit:

    Calories per serving of snack chips = 250

    Number of servings within the remaining caloric limit = Remaining calories / Calories
    per serving

    Number of servings within the remaining caloric limit = 200 / 250

    Number of servings within the remaining caloric limit = 0.8 servings


    Finally, convert the number of servings to grams:

    Total weight of the bag = 300g

    Number of servings in the bag = 5 servings

    Weight per serving = Total weight of the bag / Number of servings in the bag

    Weight per serving = 300 / 5

    Weight per serving = 60g


    Quantity of chips you can consume = Weight per serving * Number of servings within
    the remaining caloric limit

    Quantity of chips you can consume = 60g * 0.8

    Quantity of chips you can consume = 48g

- reasoning: 'Charlie can make 10 candles with each pound of beeswax. Thus, to produce
    20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax.

    - Total cost of beeswax and wicks for 2 pounds = 2 pounds * $10.00 per pound =
    $20.00

    - Revenue from selling 20 candles = 20 candles * $2.00 each = $40.00

    - Net profit = Revenue - Total Cost = $40.00 - $20.00

  answer: $20.00
- reasoning: 'Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday, and each article takes 4 hours
    to write. Therefore, on Monday, she wrote for 5 * 4 = 20 hours.


    On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. We calculate the
    number of articles she wrote on Tuesday as follows:

    5 (articles on Monday) * (1 + 2/5) = 5 * (5/5 + 2/5) = 5 * 7/5 = 7 articles. Hence,
    she wrote for 7 * 4 = 28 hours on Tuesday.


    On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she did on Tuesday. Therefore,
    she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday, which took her 14 * 4 = 56 hours.


    Adding up the total hours for all three days:

    20 hours (Monday) + 28 hours (Tuesday) + 56 hours (Wednesday) = 104 hours.

- reasoning: 'To determine the number of blue ties Jack purchased, we divide the total
    amount spent on blue ties ($200) by the price of each blue tie ($40):

    Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.


    Since Jack purchases double the number of red ties compared to blue ties, the
    number of red ties is:

    Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.


    The price of each red tie is 50% higher than the price of each blue tie. Therefore,
    the price of each red tie is:

    Price of each red tie = $40 + (0.50 * $40) = $40 + $20 = $60.


    To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties
    by the price of each red tie:

    Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60 = $600.


    Finally, the total amount Jack spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on
    blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

    Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600 = $800.
