It's given that she provides 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Let's set the total daily feed amount to T cups. Let E be the number of cups she feeds in the evening. The equation can be set up as: Total daily feed (T) = Morning feed + Afternoon feed + Evening feed. Given that T = 15 + 25 + E, we need to ensure the total matches the consistent daily amount. Thus, E = T - (15 + 25). To find the total T, we observe that Miranda feeds her flock consistent cups daily. Without E being initially specified, assume this is maintained for T = 60 cups (it's consistent each day). Therefore, E = 60 - (15 + 25) = 60 - 40 = 20. Hence, for consistency, Miranda feeds 20 cups in the evening.
