First, calculate the total investment by adding the purchase price and the repair costs: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. Next, determine the increased value of the house by calculating 150% of the initial value $80,000: $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. Finally, add this increase to the original value to find the new value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. Subtract the total investment from this new value to find the profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

<reasoning>First, calculate the distance John initially drives away from home in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

Next, calculate how far John moves during the 4 hours trying to get back home:
- For the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, John covers 0 miles.
- For the next 0.5 hours at 30 mph, the distance covered is:
Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles
- For the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph, the distance covered is:
Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Sum the distances covered on his way back home:
Return Distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

To find out how far John is from home after the 4 hours, subtract the total distance covered returning home from the initial distance traveled away from home:
Distance from home = Initial Distance - Return Distance = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles</reasoning>

First, calculate the annual earnings from the lemons:
Annual earnings = 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Next, calculate the annual costs:
Annual cost = $3

Annual profit (earnings - costs) = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Carlos initially invests $90.

Let the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with be x.

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house:
   Total sold at green house = x/3

2. After selling at the green house, she has:
   Remaining vacuum cleaners = x - x/3 = (3x - x)/3 = (2x)/3

3. She sold 2 more to the red house:
   Total sold at red house = 2

4. After selling at the red house, she has:
   Remaining vacuum cleaners = (2x)/3 - 2

5. She sold half of what was left at the orange house:
   Total sold at orange house = 1/2 * ((2x)/3 - 2) = (2x - 6)/6

6. After selling at the orange house, she has:
   Remaining vacuum cleaners = (2x)/3 - 2 - (2x - 6)/6 

7. We are given that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   (2x)/3 - 2 - (2x - 6)/6 = 5

8. Solving the equation:
   (4x - 12 - (2x - 6)) / 6 = 5
   (4x - 12 - 2x + 6) / 6 = 5
   (2x - 6) / 6 = 5
   2x - 6 = 30

<reasoning>Let's denote the cost of the first pair of high heels as \( x \). We know the first pair of heels costs $33, so \( x = 33 \).

The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair. So, the cost of the second pair of high heels is \( 2x \), which calculates to \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \).

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( x + 2x \), which is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, if we let the cost of the boots be \( b \), then \( b = 99 + 5 \).

Dana is traveling for a total of 6 hours. She spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds walking. One-third of 6 hours is 6 hours / 3 = 2 hours (running time). Two-thirds of 6 hours is 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours (walking time).

Distance traveled running = 2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles.

<reasoning>First, determine the number of blue ties John bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost per blue tie. Since he spent $200 on blue ties costing $40 each, he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties. 

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 5 * 2 = 10 red ties. 

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Therefore, the price of each red tie is 40 * 1.5 = 60 dollars. 

To find the total cost of the red ties, multiply the number of red ties by the cost per red tie: 10 * 60 = 600 dollars. 

Finally, add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties to find the total expenditure: 200 + 600 = 800 dollars.</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, we need to determine the total weight of 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so 30 comic books weigh:

30 * (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his bag, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds by removing 30 comic books. Therefore, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15

So, he needs to remove 15 toys.</reasoning>

<reasoning>The mechanic's revenue on Thursday can be calculated by multiplying the number of truck tires repaired by the rate for truck tire repair and adding it to the product of the number of car tires repaired and the rate for car tire repair. Similarly, the revenue for Friday is calculated by multiplying the number of car tires repaired by the rate for car tire repair. The revenue for Thursday and Friday is then compared to determine the day with higher revenue, and the difference in revenue between the two days is the final conclusion.

Repaired tires on Thursday:
Truck tires: 6
Car tires: 4
Revenue on Thursday = (6 truck tires * $60) + (4 car tires * $40) = $360 + $160 = $520

Repaired tires on Friday:
Truck tires: 0
Car tires: 12
Revenue on Friday = 0 + (12 car tires * $40) = $480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 - $480 = $40

Thursday had the higher revenue of $520, and the difference between Thursday and Friday is $40.</reasoning>

<reasoning>We start with the top level having a square footage of 16. As each subsequent level doubles the square footage from the level above it, the second level will have a square footage of 16 * 2 = 32, the third level will have 32 * 2 = 64, and the fourth level will have 64 * 2 = 128. 

So, the square footages of the four levels are: 16, 32, 64, and 128. 

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum these values and divide by the number of levels. Therefore, the total square footage is 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240. 

Dividing this sum by the number of levels (4), we get 240 / 4 = 60.

On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours (1-hour episode + 30-minute show). On Friday, he watched 2 hours (two 1-hour episodes). Therefore, the total time watched from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours. Since the total given is 7 hours, there is an inconsistency here. Rechecking, Monday and Tuesday add up to 2 hours, Thursday adds up to 1.5 hours, and Friday adds 2 hours, totalling 5.5 hours. This leaves 1.5 hours available on Wednesday for 30-minute episodes.

Total for Beatrice = 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups.

Marcell's roll-ups:
Width = 3 roll-ups, Length = 14 roll-ups
Total for Marcell = 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Next, we calculate the combined total number of roll-ups they ate:
Total combined roll-ups = 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.

<reasoning>Let's break down the problem step by step. 

1. Four years ago, Adrien's salary was $40,000.
2. Four years ago, Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. So, Lylah's salary four years ago can be calculated as follows:
   Lylah's salary = Adrien's salary / 1.30
   Lylah's salary = 40000 / 1.30
   Lylah's salary = $30,769.23 (approximately)

3. Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. So, the new salary for Adrien is:
   New Adrien's salary = 40000 + (40% of 40000)
   New Adrien's salary = 40000 + 16000
   New Adrien's salary = $56000

4. Let's assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40% over the 4 years.
   New Lylah's salary = 30769.23 + (40% of 30769.23)
   New Lylah's salary = 30769.23 + 12307.69
   New Lylah's salary = $43,076.92

5. The total salary four years later for both would be the sum of their new salaries.

<reasoning>Initially, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
In the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
She then sees two times 30 bees, which is 60 bees, leave in the next 6 hours.
Finally, every bee that left before and didn't already return, returns in the last 6 hours. So, the bees that left totalled to 30 + 60 = 90 bees. Of these 90 bees, 15 already returned in the second 6 hours. Thus, the number of bees remaining to return in the last 6 hours is 90 - 15 = 75 bees.

We are told that Charlie has 12 friends, therefore 3D = 12. We can solve for D by dividing both sides by 3, which gives us D = 4. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we calculate James's friends as 4D. Substituting D = 4 into this equation, we get James's friends as 4 * 4, which is 16.</reasoning>

The first step is to determine how long it takes for each person to get home. 
Steve lives 3 miles away and bikes at 440 feet per minute. First, we need to convert the distance to feet:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet.

Next, we divide the distance by Steve's speed:
15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.

Tim lives 2 miles away and skates at 264 feet per minute. Converting the distance to feet:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet.

Next, we divide the distance by Tim's speed:
10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

The winner is the person who takes the least time. Steve takes 36 minutes, whereas Tim takes 40 minutes. Therefore, Steve wins. 

To find out how long Steve will be waiting for Tim, we subtract Steve's time from Tim's time:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

3. Pigeons ate 3 fries each and there were 3 pigeons: 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. After Dave and the animals ate, the remaining fries were:
   x - 14 (Dave) - 7 (seagull) - 9 (pigeons) = x - 30 fries.
5. A raccoon then took two thirds of the remaining fries:
   Remaining fries: x - 30
   Raccoon takes: (2/3)(x - 30)
   Fries left after raccoon: (1/3)(x - 30).
6. The number of fries left by ants is given to be 5 fries. Thus:
   (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5
7. Solve the equation for x:
   (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   (1/3)(x - 30) = 6
   x - 30 = 18

<reasoning>First, we analyze the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. The probability of rolling one of these numbers is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 (or 50%).

Next, we analyze the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. On a six-sided die, the even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling one even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 (or 50%). Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 (or 25%).

To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, and then express it as a percentage:
(50% - 25%) = 25%.

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, we will find out the total pieces of straw given to the hamsters. There are 10 hamsters, each receiving 5 pieces of straw, so

Total straw for hamsters = 10 * 5 = 50 pieces

Next, we will find out the total pieces of straw given to the rabbits. The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

Now we calculate the total pieces of straw distributed to the rats. The total distributed straw is 160, so

Total straw for rats = 160 - 50 (hamsters) - 20 (rabbits) = 90 pieces

Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw and the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, so

Let the number of rats in each cage be x.
Total number of rats = 3x

Thus, the total straw for the rats would be 6 * 3x = 18x.

We already calculated that the total straw for the rats is 90, thus

18x = 90
x = 90 / 18
x = 5

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.

To calculate the total amount Mandy owes after 3 months, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where P is the principal amount ($100), r is the annual interest rate (0.02 * 12 = 0.24), n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year (12), and t is the time in years (3/12 = 0.25). Here, we simplify as it's monthly compounding so P(1 + 0.02)^3.

First, we calculate the total cost of the tickets: $20.25
Next, we calculate the cost of food which is $4.50 less than the tickets: $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75
Now, we calculate the total cost of the rides: 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66
Then, we add up all the costs: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102
Finally, we divide the total cost by the number of friends (3) to find out how much each friend pays: $102 / 3 = $34

<reasoning>First, we need to determine the total amount of insects the flock of ten ducks needs per week. Each duck needs 3.5 pounds per week, so for ten ducks, it would be 10 * 3.5 pounds = 35 pounds per week. Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects this is per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total weekly requirement by 7: 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds per day.</reasoning>

<reasoning>Tom starts with 50 trees. Every year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, a net gain of 8 trees per year. Over 10 years:
Total trees planted = 10 years * 10 trees/year = 100 trees
Total trees chopped = 10 years * 2 trees/year = 20 trees
Net gain = 100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees
Trees after 10 years = 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees
30% of the trees die after 10 years:
30% of 130 trees = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees
Trees that survive = 130 - 39 = 91 trees</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, note that the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard on Friday morning. On Saturday morning, they took back one third of the 18 flamingos. Calculating one third of 18 gives us 6 flamingos. These 6 flamingos were then painted white and put back on the front yard. So, by Saturday morning, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos on the yard.

On Sunday morning, an additional 18 pink flamingos were added to the front yard. Adding these to the 12 pink flamingos already present gives us a total of 30 pink flamingos.

By noon on Sunday, we compare the number of pink flamingos to white flamingos: There are 30 pink flamingos, and there are 6 white flamingos. Therefore, to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.</reasoning>

<reasoning>A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. Therefore, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is $1.20 + $0.30 which equals $1.50. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined, one pen costs $1.50. To find the cost of 8 pens, multiply the cost of one pen ($1.50) by 8.</reasoning>

<reasoning>The total quantity of carrots available is 200 pounds. Each of the 40 restaurants receives 2 pounds of carrots. To find the total quantity distributed, we multiply the number of restaurants by the amount each restaurant receives: 40 restaurants * 2 pounds per restaurant = 80 pounds. To find the remaining carrots, we subtract the distributed quantity from the total quantity: 200 pounds - 80 pounds.</reasoning>

<reasoning>Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After one month, she collected three times that number, so she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, so she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards collected in the first and second months, so she collected \(2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200\) cards. Therefore, the total number of cards she has now is \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\) cards.</reasoning>

<reasoning>
Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both Publisher A and Publisher B. Therefore, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher per week.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. So, for Publisher A, Mark makes 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, for Publisher B, Mark makes 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

So, in total, Mark makes 2500 cents (from Publisher A) + 5000 cents (from Publisher B) = 7500 cents in a week.
