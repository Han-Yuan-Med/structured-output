Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so we multiply the number of comic books by their weight: 30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 30/4 pounds = 7.5 pounds. Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, so we subtract the weight he has already removed: 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so we now divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy: 7.5 pounds / 1/2 pound/toy = 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys. Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys to achieve removing a total of 15 pounds from his book bag.", "answer": "15"}, {"reasoning": "First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday. The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and charges $60 per truck tire, so the revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360. The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires and charges $40 per car tire, so the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520. Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday. The mechanic repairs 12 car tires and charges $40 per car tire, so the revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. Since no truck tires were repaired on Friday, the total revenue on Friday is $480. Now, we determine which day had the higher revenue: Thursday with $520 or Friday with $480. Thursday had the higher revenue. We then find the difference in revenue between the two days: $520 - $480 = $40.", "answer": "40"}, {"reasoning": "The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours. Summing these hours gives 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. Since he watched 7 hours in total, the remaining time to account for Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Next, calculate the amount of water taken on over the total distance. The boat takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet, so for 80 feet: 80 feet / 10 feet per segment = 8 segments.
