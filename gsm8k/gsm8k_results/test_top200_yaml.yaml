    is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

    Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
    Therefore, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 4 hours walking. The distance

    Revenue_per_gallon = 20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10 per gallon.

- reasoning: "Tom begins with 50 trees. Each year, he adds 10 trees and removes 2\
    \ trees. \nOver 10 years, the net gain per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.\nAfter 10\
    \ years, the total net gain is 10 years * 8 trees/year = 80 trees.\nAdding this\
    \ gain to the initial trees: 50 + 80 = 130 trees.\nAfter 10 years, 30% of the\
    \ trees die. Therefore, 30% of 130 trees die, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.\n\
    Subtracting the dead trees from the total: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.\n"
  answer: '91'
- reasoning: 'On Friday morning, there were 18 pink flamingos. On Saturday morning,
    1/3 of these flamingos were taken back, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. These 6
    flamingos were painted white and put back on the front yard. Therefore, there
    are 6 white flamingos and 12 pink flamingos on Saturday morning. On Sunday morning,
    18 more pink flamingos were added. Thus, the number of pink flamingos on Sunday
    is 12 + 18 = 30. The difference between the number of pink flamingos (30) and
    white flamingos (6) is 30 - 6 = 24.

- reasoning: 'Violetta needs 5 different colored crayons. Each crayon costs $2.

    - First, calculate the total cost of buying 5 crayons: 5 crayons * $2/crayon =
    $10.

    - Violetta prepared $20 for the purchase.

    - Subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount prepared: $20 - $10 =
    $10.

    '
  answer: $10
- reasoning: 'First, we determine the cost of one pen by adding the cost of one pencil
    and one eraser:

    Cost of one pencil = $1.20

    Cost of one eraser = $0.30

    Total cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50


    Next, we calculate the cost of 8 pens:

    Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50 = $12.00

    '
  answer: $12.00
- reasoning: 'To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first calculate
    the total amount of carrots distributed. Since each restaurant receives 2 pounds,
    we multiply 2 pounds by the number of restaurants (40). This equals 80 pounds.

    Next, we subtract the amount of carrots distributed (80 pounds) from the original
    amount of carrots (200 pounds).

- reasoning: "To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract\
    \ the number of men and the number of women from the total population. \nGiven\
    \ the total population is 23786 inhabitants, the number of men is 8417, and the\
    \ number of women is 9092, we perform the following calculation:\n\nNumber of\
    \ children = Total population - Number of men - Number of women\n            \
    \       = 23786 - 8417 - 9092\n                   = 23786 - 17509\n\nThen, we\

  answer: '6277'
- reasoning: 'Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.

    After a month, she collected three times that number:

    3 * 20 = 60 cards.


    In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in
    the first month:

    60 - 20 = 40 cards.


    In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected
    in the first and second months:

    Combined number of cards collected in the first and second months: 60 + 40 = 100
    cards.

    Twice this number: 2 * 100 = 200 cards.


    To find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now:

    Initial number of cards + First month collection + Second month collection + Third
    month collection:

    20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

  answer: '320'
- reasoning: '"Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two publishers,
    so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B. Publisher
    A pays him 5 cents per sentence, and Publisher B pays him twice as much, which
    is 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, Mark makes:


    Earnings from Publisher A: 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

    Earnings from Publisher B: 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents


    Adding both earnings together gives:

    2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents"
