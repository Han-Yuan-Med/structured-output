That means the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.", "answer": "6"}, {"reasoning": "To determine the profit Sasha makes, first we need to calculate the new selling prices of the boards after the 50% price increase. For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the original price is $10 each; so the increased price is $10 + 50% = $10 + $5 = $15 per board. For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the original price is $16 each; so the increased price is $16 + 50% = $16 + $8 = $24 per board. Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all boards at the increased prices. For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $15 * 10 = $150. For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $24 * 5 = $120. Adding these sums gives the total revenue: $150 + $120 = $270. Finally, we find the total original cost of the boards and subtract it from the total revenue to get the profit. The original cost for the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 * 10 = $100. The original cost for the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16 * 5 = $80. Adding these sums gives the total original cost: $100 + $80 = $180.
