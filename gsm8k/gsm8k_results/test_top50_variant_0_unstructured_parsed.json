Add together the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent.\n\nStep 1: How many blue ties did Sam purchase?\n\nHe spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.\n\nNumber of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie\n                    = $200 / $40\n                    = 5 blue ties.\n\nStep 2: How many red ties did Sam purchase?\n\nThe ratio is 1 blue tie : 2 red ties. So, for each blue tie, there are 2 red ties.\n\nNumber of red ties = Number of blue ties * 2\n                   = 5 * 2\n                   = 10 red ties.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the cost of the red ties.\n\nThe red ties are 50% more expensive than the blue ties. Since a blue tie costs $40, a red tie costs:\nCost of one red tie = 40 + (50% of 40)\n                    = 40 + (0.50 * 40)\n                    = 40 + 20\n                    = $60.\n\nSam bought 10 red ties, so:\nTotal cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie\n                       = 10 * $60\n                       = $600.\n\nStep 4: Find the total amount spent on all ties.\n\nTotal amount spent = Total cost of blue ties + Total cost of red ties\n                   = $200 + $600\n                   = $800.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n800", "parsed": "800"}, {"response": "To solve the given problem, let\u2019s break it down into smaller steps:\n\n1. **Convert the total length of the wire into inches.**\n   - Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 48 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of 6-inch segments that can be made from 48 inches.**\n   - By dividing the total length by the length of each segment, we get:\n     \\[\n     48 \\text{ inches} \\div 6 \\text{ inches/segment} = 8 \\text{ segments}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Tracy ended up with 8 segments.\n\n8", "parsed": "8"}, {"response": "To determine the number of vacant apartments in the entire complex, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of apartments in the complex:**\n   - Each building level has 8 apartments.\n   - The complex has 15 levels.\n   Therefore, the total number of apartments in the complex is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ levels} \\times 8 \\text{ apartments per level} = 120 \\text{ apartments}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of occupied apartments:**\n   - The occupancy rate is 75%.\n   - Therefore, the number of occupied apartments is:\n   \\[\n   75\\% \\text{ of } 120 \\text{ apartments} = 0.75 \\times 120 = 90 \\text{ apartments}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of vacant apartments:**\n   - Total apartments = 120\n   - Occupied apartments = 90\n   Therefore, the number of vacant apartments is:\n   \\[\n   120 - 90 = 30 \\text{ apartments}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the number of vacant apartments in the entire complex is:\n\n30", "parsed": "30"}]
