    these steps:

    - First, calculate his total investment by summing the purchase price and the

    is boosted by 150%.

    - Lastly, subtract the total investment from the new market value to find the

    \ model car for $15. \nThe total amount he earns from selling all 13 model cars\
    \ is 13 * $15 = $195.\nHe buys 8 books, each costing $20. \nThe total amount spent\
    \ on books is 8 * $20 = $160.\nHe retains $5 after buying the books.\nSo, the\

- reasoning: 'Initially, Eli''s throwing distance was 400 feet. When Eli gripped the
    enchanted emerald, his throwing distance tripled. Thus, his new throwing distance
    is 3 times 400 feet, which equals 1200 feet. The dragon''s fiery range extends
    1000 feet. To determine the safe distance beyond the dragon''s fiery reach from
    which Eli can still strike the dragon, subtract the dragon''s fiery range (1000
    feet) from Eli''s enhanced throwing distance (1200 feet):


    1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet


    Therefore, Eli can position himself 200 feet beyond the dragon''s fiery reach
    and still strike the dragon with the silver spear.

- reasoning: 'To determine the amount of chips that can be consumed based on the remaining
    calorie limit, first calculate how many calories are left within the daily limit:

    2000 - 1800 = 200 calories remaining.


    Next, calculate the number of portions that can be consumed within the remaining
    200 calories. Since each portion has 250 calories, and 200 calories < 250 calories,
    it is not possible to consume a complete portion. Instead, calculate the fraction
    of a portion that corresponds to the remaining calories:

    Fraction of portion = 200 calories / 250 calories per portion = 0.8 portions.


    Finally, convert the fraction of a portion back into grams, given that the pack
    is 300g and contains 5 portions:

    300g / 5 portions = 60g per portion.

    Grams to consume = 0.8 portions * 60g per portion = 48 grams.

- reasoning: 'Ella can produce 10 candles from one pound of beeswax. To produce 20
    candles, she would need 2 pounds of beeswax.

    The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is 2 x $10.00 = $20.00.

    Ella sells each candle for $2.00. So, selling 20 candles will generate 20 x $2.00
    = $40.00.

    Ella''s net profit is calculated by subtracting her total costs from her total

    Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

    post-it notes from the pack she bought. Throughout her shift, she used 220 post-it
    notes. At the end of the day, she had 23 post-it notes left.


    Let''s define the number of post-it notes in the pack she bought as "x".


    The total number of post-it notes she had initially (including the pack bought)
    would be:

    80 + x


    She then used 220 post-it notes, so the remaining number of post-it notes would
    be:

    (80 + x) - 220


    According to the problem, she had 23 post-it notes left. So:

    (80 + x) - 220 = 23


    Solving for "x":

    80 + x - 220 = 23

    x - 140 = 23

    x = 23 + 140

    x = 163

- reasoning: 'To find out how much Sam spent on all the ties, we need to follow these
    steps:

    1. Determine how many blue ties Sam bought by dividing the total amount spent
    on blue ties by the price of each blue tie.

    2. Calculate the number of red ties Sam bought using the given ratio.

    3. Determine the cost of one red tie, taking into account that red ties are 50%
    more expensive than blue ties.

    4. Calculate the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red
    ties by the price of one red tie.

    5. Sum the amounts spent on blue ties and red ties to get the total amount spent
    on all ties.


    Step-by-step calculations:

    1. Total amount spent on blue ties = $200

    2. Price per blue tie = $40

    3. Number of blue ties = 200 / 40 = 5

    4. Number of red ties (since for every blue tie, 2 red ties are bought) = 5 *
    2 = 10

    5. Price per red tie (50% more expensive than blue ties) = 40 * 1.5 = $60

    6. Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * 60 = $600

    7. Total amount spent on all ties = amount spent on blue ties + amount spent on
    red ties = $200 + $600 = $800
