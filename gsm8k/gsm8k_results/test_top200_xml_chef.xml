Start by determining how much white fiber is needed.
Since it needs half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and it uses 2 bolts of blue fiber:
1/2 of 2 bolts of blue fiber = 1 bolt of white fiber.
Now, add the blue fiber and the white fiber together:
2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts in total.

To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, follow these steps: 
1. Calculate the total initial investment by adding the purchase price and the cost of repairs.
2. Increase the house's value by the given percentage.
3. Subtract the total initial investment from the new value to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total initial investment:
$80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000

Step 2: Increase the value of the house by 150%:
150% of the initial investment = 1.5 * $130,000 = $195,000
New house value = $130,000 + $195,000 = $325,000

Step 3: Calculate the profit:
New house value ($325,000) - total initial investment ($130,000) = $195,000

To determine the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we begin by calculating the total daily feed for all her chickens. Each chicken gets three cups of feed daily, and with 20 chickens, the total daily feed required is 20 chickens * 3 cups per chicken = 60 cups. 

Next, we need to determine how much of this total feed of 60 cups has already been provided in the morning and afternoon meals. In the morning, she provides 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she provides 25 cups. Thus, the combined total already given is 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

The amount of feed Wendi needs to give in the final meal is the difference between the total feed required and the combined feed already provided: 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

Each odd-numbered glass costs $5, and each even-numbered glass costs 60% of $5.
Firstly, 60% of $5 is calculated as $5 * 0.60 = $3.
Thus, for every pair of glasses (one odd and one even), Kylar pays $5 + $3 = $8.
Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. 
Since there are 8 pairs in 16 glasses (16 / 2 = 8 pairs), 
we multiply the cost of one pair by 8, i.e., $8 * 8 = $64.

1. Determine the total distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
   Distance = Speed x Time
   Distance = 60 mph x 3 hours
   Distance = 180 miles

2. Calculate the distance covered during the standstill traffic (2 hours):
   Distance = 0 miles (since he is not moving)

3. Calculate the distance traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:
   Distance = Speed x Time
   Distance = 30 mph x 0.5 hours
   Distance = 15 miles

4. Calculate the remaining driving time:
   Total available time: 4 hours
   Time used in standstill traffic: 2 hours
   Time used driving at 30 mph: 0.5 hours
   Remaining time = 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours

5. Calculate the distance covered in the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph:
   Distance = Speed x Time
   Distance = 80 mph x 1.5 hours
   Distance = 120 miles

6. Add the distances covered after he turns around: 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (half-hour driving) + 120 miles (1.5 hours driving) = 135 miles

First, let's designate the number of gold coins as G and the number of silver coins as S. According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, which gives us the equation G = S + 30. Additionally, we know that the total number of coins is 110, giving us another equation: G + S = 110. 

We can substitute the expression for G from the first equation into the second equation:
(S + 30) + S = 110.

Combining like terms, we get:
2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with S:
2S = 80.

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for S:
S = 40.

Since S represents the number of silver coins, we need to find G which is S + 30:
G = 40 + 30.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

First, we determine Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour and skipping is half as fast as running, Dana's running speed is 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Next, we determine Dana's walking speed. Running is four times faster than walking, so her walking speed is 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, allocate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of 6 hours running, which is 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours running.

She spends two-thirds of 6 hours walking, which is 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

Calculate the distance traveled by running: Distance_running = speed_running * time_running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

Calculate the distance traveled by walking: Distance_walking = speed_walking * time_walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Summing these distances gives the total distance: 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

First, determine Sylvie's monthly salary after her 5-year increase. She gets a 10% increase on her initial monthly salary of $600.
10% of $600 is $600 * 0.10 = $60.
So, her new monthly salary becomes $600 + $60 = $660.

Next, calculate her monthly salary after one year (sixth year) of increased salary. 
We apply another 10% increase to $660.
10% of $660 is $660 * 0.10 = $66.
So, her new monthly salary becomes $660 + $66 = $726.

Then, calculate her salary after the second year (seventh year).
10% of $726 is $726 * 0.10 = $72.60.
So, her new monthly salary becomes $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.

Now, calculate her salary after the third additional year (eighth year).
10% of $798.60 is $798.60 * 0.10 = $79.86.
So, her new monthly salary becomes $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46.

2. Then the number of copies Marilyn sold would be 10 times H, or 10H.
3. According to the problem, their combined sales amount to 88,000 copies.
4. Therefore, we set up the equation: H + 10H = 88,000.
5. Combine like terms to get: 11H = 88,000.
6. To solve for H, divide both sides by 11: H = 88,000 / 11.

<reasoning>Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \). This year, he wanted to make twice as many cookies as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so the total number of cookies baked is \( 2x + 15 \). He then dropped 5 cookies, resulting in \( (2x + 15 - 5) = 2x + 10 \) cookies left. We know he now has 110 cookies, so we set up the equation \( 2x + 10 = 110 \). Solving for \( x \) involves subtracting 10 from both sides to get \( 2x = 100 \). Dividing both sides by 2, we find \( x = 50 \). Hence, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.</reasoning>

Step 1: Define the variables.
Let Q represent the number of queen bees.
Let B represent the number of baby bees.
Let W represent the number of worker bees.

Step 2: Set up the relationships.
We know that:
B = 2Q (twice as many babies as queens)
W = 2B (twice as many workers as babies)

Step 3: Express the total number of bees.
Q + B + W = 700

Step 4: Substitute B and W in terms of Q.
B = 2Q 
W = 2B 
W = 2(2Q) = 4Q

Step 5: Substitute B and W back into the total equation.
Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700
7Q = 700

Step 6: Solve for Q.
Q = 100

Step 7: Find the number of baby bees (B).
B = 2Q
B = 2 * 100
B = 200

Step 8: Find the number of worker bees (W).

4. After the seagull, the remaining fries are (X - 14) - 7 = X - 21.
5. Each of the three pigeons ate 3 fries, so they together ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
6. The fries left after the pigeons are (X - 21) - 9 = X - 30.
7. The raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so it took 2/3 of (X - 30).
8. Leftover fries after the raccoon are (1/3)*(X - 30).

First, we calculate the total distance Blake runs:
Blake runs back and forth 15 times the length of the football field.
Each back and forth run is 100 yards + 100 yards.
Total distance Blake runs = 15 * (100 yards + 100 yards) = 15 * 200 yards = 3000 yards.
Next, we calculate the total distance Kelly runs:
Kelly first runs back and forth once the length of the football field, which is 100 yards + 100 yards = 200 yards.
Then Kelly runs back and forth 34 times to the 40-yard line.
Each back and forth run to the 40-yard line is 40 yards + 40 yards.
Total distance for the 34 runs = 34 * (40 yards + 40 yards) = 34 * 80 yards = 2720 yards.
Total distance Kelly runs = 200 yards + 2720 yards = 2920 yards.
Now, we compare the distances.
Blake runs 3000 yards, and Kelly runs 2920 yards.
Difference = 3000 yards - 2920 yards = 80 yards.

<reasoning>First, we find the number of periods in 36 months, which is 36 / 2 = 18 periods. Next, we calculate the increase in price for each period. The price increases by 20% of $20 every two months. Thus, the price increase per period is 20% of $20, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4. Therefore, the new price at the end of each period is the previous price plus $4. We start with $20 and add $4 for each of the 18 periods.
So, the total increase over 18 periods is 18 * $4 = $72. Finally, the new price after 36 months is the original price plus the total increase, which is:

First, we need to find out how many gallons they made to generate $25 in profit.

Each gallon of lemonade costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, making the total cost per gallon:
$3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5 per gallon.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, which means the revenue per gallon is:
20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10 per gallon.

The profit per gallon is the revenue minus the cost:
$10 (revenue) - $5 (cost) = $5 profit per gallon.

If they made $25 in profit, we divide the total profit by the profit per gallon:
$25 profit / $5 profit per gallon = 5 gallons.

The cost for lemons per gallon is $3, so for 5 gallons, we multiply:
5 gallons * $3 per gallon = $15 spent on lemons.

Step 1: Determine the number of crabs Bo has, which is 40.
Step 2: Calculate the number of crabs Monic has, which is 4 fewer than Bo. Therefore, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Step 3: Calculate the number of crabs Rani has, which is 10 more than Monic. Therefore, Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.
Step 4: Add the number of crabs each person has to find the total number. Bo has 40, Monic has 36, and Rani has 46. The sum is 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs.

First, let's denote the number of white carnations as W. According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies ordered is 5 times the number of white carnations, which is 5W. Given that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, we can set up the equation 5W = 200. Solving for W, we get W = 200 / 5, which simplifies to W = 40. 
Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Since W = 40, the number of red roses ordered is 4 * W, which is 4 * 40.

Step 1: Let Jan's current age be 30.
Step 2: Two years ago, Jan's age was 28 (30 - 2).
Step 3: Let Mark's age two years ago be M.
Step 4: According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. This equation is represented as: M = (28 / 2) + 5.
Step 5: Simplifying the equation: M = 14 + 5 = 19.
Step 6: So Mark's age two years ago was 19.
Step 7: Therefore, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21.
Step 8: Jean is two years older than Mark. So Jean's age is 21 + 2.

1. Calculate the total time for the well-rounded team:
   - Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
   - There are four members: 4 members * 55 seconds per member = 220 seconds.
   
2. Calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team:
   - The first runner takes 60 seconds.
   - The second runner takes 57 seconds.
   - The third runner takes 54 seconds.
   - The fourth runner takes 51 seconds.
   - Total time = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

3. Determine the difference in time:
   - Well-rounded team: 220 seconds.
   - Less well-rounded team: 222 seconds.
   - Difference: 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

Thus, the faster team will win by 2 seconds.

<reasoning>First, we determine the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 on the die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
P(roll &gt; 3) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%

Next, we determine the probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on the die are 2, 4, and 6, giving us 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
P(even) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
P(two evens) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%

To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than it is to roll two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:

Difference in probability (as percentage) = 50% - 25% = 25%</reasoning>

Step 1: Let's define the variables:
- Let R be the number of rats in each cage.
- The total number of rats is 3R since there are 3 cages.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of straw used by the rats:
- Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- Total straw for rats = 3R * 6 = 18R.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of straw used by the hamsters:
- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 hamsters.
- Total straw for hamsters = 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of straw used by the rabbits:
- Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces of straw.

Step 5: Use the total amount of straw distributed (160 pieces) to form the equation:
- 18R (rats) + 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 160.

Step 6: Solve the equation:
- 18R + 70 = 160.
- 18R = 90.
- R = 90 / 18.
- R = 5.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

Start with the principal amount Mandy owes, which is $100. Given the monthly interest rate is 2%, we need to calculate the amount for each month including the interest.

For the first month: Principal = $100, Interest = $100 * 0.02 = $2, New amount = $100 + $2 = $102.
For the second month: Principal = $102, Interest = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04, New amount = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04.
For the third month: Principal = $104.04, Interest = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.08 (approximately), New amount = $104.04 + $2.08 = $106.12.

After 3 months, Mandy should pay $106.12.

1. Let the number of bags be \( x \).
2. The cost of buying \( x \) bags of wheat at $20 per bag is \( 20x \).
3. The cost of transporting \( x \) bags at $2 per bag is \( 2x \).
4. The total cost for the trader is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \).
5. The selling price of \( x \) bags at $30 per bag is \( 30x \).
6. The trader's profit is the difference between the selling price and the total cost: \( 30x - 22x = 8x \).
7. According to the problem, the trader's profit is $400.
8. Therefore, \( 8x = 400 \).
9. Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 8: \( x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \).
