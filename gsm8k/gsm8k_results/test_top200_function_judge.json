Violetta needs 5 crayons, one in each of the 5 different colors.\n2. Each crayon costs $2.\n3. Therefore, the total cost of the crayons is 5 crayons * $2 per crayon = $10.\n4. Violetta has prepared $20 for this purchase.\n5. The change Violetta will get is the amount she prepared minus the total cost of the crayons, which is $20 - $10.\n\nBased on the reasoning steps above, the amount of change Violetta will get is:", "answer": "$10"}, {"reasoning": "To determine the cost of 8 pens, we first need to find the cost of a single pen. According to the problem, the cost of one pen is equal to the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser. \n\n1. Calculate the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser:\nCost of pencil = $1.20\nCost of eraser = $0.30\nCombined cost = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50\n\n2. The cost of one pen is $1.50.\n\n3. To find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:\nCost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50 = $12.00\n\nTherefore, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00.", "answer": "$12.00"}, {"reasoning": "To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first calculate the total amount of carrots distributed. Each of the 40 restaurants receives 2 pounds of carrots, so we multiply 40 by 2, which gives us 80 pounds. We then subtract the total distributed from the initial amount of carrots.\n\nInitial amount of carrots: 200 pounds\nTotal distributed: 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds\nCarrots not used: 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds", "answer": "120"}, {"reasoning": "To determine the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.\n2. After the first month, she collected three times that number: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.\n3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.\n4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months: 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.\n\nNow, let's add all the Pokemon cards she has:\n- Initial: 20 cards\n- First month: 60 cards\n- Second month: 40 cards\n- Third month: 200 cards\n\nTotal: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards", "answer": "320"}, {"reasoning": "Let's denote the number of sentences edited for each publisher as 'x'. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, we have:\n\nx + x = 1000\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2x = 1000\nx = 500\n\nTherefore, Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.\n\nPublisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. Hence, the total amount earned from Publisher A is:\n\n500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents\n\nSince Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, the total amount earned from Publisher B is:\n\n500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents\n\nAdding both amounts together, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:\n\n2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.\n", "answer": "7500"}]
