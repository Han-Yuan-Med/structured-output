    Running time = 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours.


    Dana is walking for the remaining two-thirds of the time, which is:

    Walking time = 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours.


    The distance Dana covers when running is:

    Distance (running) = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.


    The distance Dana covers when walking is:

    Distance (walking) = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.


    The total distance Dana covers in six hours is:

    Total distance = Distance (running) + Distance (walking)

    Total distance = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

    - Ben''s phone is double the age of Suzy''s phone: 1 year * 2 = 2 years.

    - Brandon''s phone is four times the age of Ben''s phone: 2 years * 4 = 8 years.

    she grips the emerald stone, her throwing distance triples. Therefore, her new
    throwing distance is 400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet. The dragon''s fiery breath has
    a radius of 1000 feet. To determine how far beyond the dragon''s fiery reach Lila
    can stand and still strike the dragon, we calculate the difference between her
    new throwing distance and the radius of the dragon''s fiery breath. This is 1200
    feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet. Thus, Lila can safely stand 200 feet beyond the dragon''s
    fiery reach and still strike Glorian.

    the total number of slices is 5 pies * 8 slices per pie = 40 slices. By the end
    of the event, there were 14 slices left over. We can calculate the number of slices

- reasoning: 'The first step is to determine how many calories are remaining from
    the daily limit. The daily limit is 2000 calories, and 1800 calories have already
    been consumed, which leaves 200 calories remaining.


    Next, we need to calculate the calories per gram of chips. Since one serving is
    50 grams (300 grams divided by 5 servings) and contains 250 calories, we divide
    250 calories by 50 grams to find the calories per gram:

    250 calories / 50 grams = 5 calories per gram.


    Finally, to find the number of grams that corresponds to the remaining 200 calories,
    we divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram:

    200 calories / 5 calories per gram = 40 grams.

  answer: 40 grams
- reasoning: 'Charlie can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, which costs $10.00.
    To produce and sell 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (since 20 candles
    require twice the amount of beeswax). Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of
    beeswax is $10.00/pound x 2 = $20.00. He sells each candle for $2.00, so selling
    20 candles will generate $2.00 x 20 = $40.00 in revenue. The net profit is calculated
    by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

- reasoning: '"First, we determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day:


    - Monday: 5 articles

    - Tuesday: 2/5 more articles than Monday which means \(2/5 \times 5 = 2\) additional
    articles, so \(5 + 2 = 7\) articles.

    - Wednesday: double the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday which means \(2
    \times 7 = 14\) articles.


    Next, we add up the articles for all three days:

    \(5 + 7 + 14 = 26\) articles in total.


    Each article takes her 4 hours. Therefore, the total duration is \(26 \times 4

    her total number of sticky notes is 80 plus the amount in the purchased pack.
    During her shift, she used one sticky note for each of the 220 coffee cups she
    prepared, resulting in the use of 220 sticky notes. At the end of her shift, she
    had 23 sticky notes left. Therefore, we can calculate the number of sticky notes
    in the purchased pack by the following steps:

    1. Let the number of sticky notes in the purchased pack be x.

    2. The total number of sticky notes Candice had before using any was 80 + x.

    3. After using 220 sticky notes, the number of sticky notes left was 23.

    4. So, (80 + x - 220) = 23.

    5. Simplifying, we get 80 + x - 220 = 23.

    6. Rearranging, we find x = 163.

    Therefore, the number of sticky notes in the purchased pack is 163."

- reasoning: 'James purchased blue ties for a total of $200, with each tie priced
    at $40. Hence, the number of blue ties he bought is:

    Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5.


    The number of red ties James purchased is twice the number of blue ties:

    Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties = 2 * 5 = 10.


    The price of each red tie is 50% higher than the price of each blue tie:

    Price of each red tie = Price of each blue tie * 1.5 = $40 * 1.5 = $60.


    Therefore, the total expenditure on red ties is:

    Total cost for red ties = Number of red ties * Price of each red tie = 10 * $60
    = $600.


    Finally, the total expenditure on all ties is:

    Total expenditure = Total cost for blue ties + Total cost for red ties = $200
    + $600 = $800.

    apartments in the building. Since there are 15 stories and each story has 8 apartments,
    we multiply 15 by 8, which equals 120 apartments in total.

    Next, we determine how many of these apartments are filled. Since 75% are filled,
    we calculate 75% of 120 by multiplying 0.75 by 120. This equals 90 apartments
    that are filled.

    Finally, we subtract the number of filled apartments from the total number of
