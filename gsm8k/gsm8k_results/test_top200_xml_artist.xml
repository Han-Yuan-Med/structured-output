<reasoning>First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left to sell. Each day, Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins. This means she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day for personal use. Therefore, she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell. Each egg sells for $2, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market.</reasoning>

<reasoning>The problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. It also mentions that it takes half as much white fiber. 

Start by considering what "half that much" means in relation to the blue fiber:
- Blue fiber required: 2 bolts
- White fiber required: 2 bolts * 1/2 = 1 bolt

Next, sum up the quantities of the blue and white fiber needed:
- Total fiber needed = blue fiber + white fiber = 2 bolts + 1 bolt

Thus, adding these both together gives us the total bolts required to make the robe.</reasoning>

Josh buys a house for $80,000 and invests an additional $50,000 in repairs, bringing his total expenditure to $130,000. The $50,000 in repairs increases the house's value by 150%. We first calculate the new value of the house. 

150% of $80,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 80,000 \times 1.50 = 120,000 \]

We then add this increase to the original price to find the new house value:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Now, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenditure from the new house value:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

<reasoning>John first drives 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance covered in those 3 hours is 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.

On his way back home:
- The first 2 hours are spent in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
- In the next half-hour (0.5 hours) at a speed of 30 mph, he covers 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.
- In the remaining 1.5 hours at a speed of 80 mph, he covers 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.
   
Adding the covered distances on the return trip: 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

The distance John traveled initially to reach his furthest point was 180 miles. After driving 135 miles on his return trip, he still has 180 miles - 135 miles left to travel.

The final distance from home at the end of 4 hours is 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.</reasoning>

First, we calculate the yearly profit from the lemons. Each year, the lemon tree will produce 7 lemons, which Carlos can sell for $1.5 each:
7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year.

Next, we account for the yearly cost to water and feed the tree, which is $3/year.

To find the yearly net profit, we subtract the yearly cost from the income:
$10.5/year - $3/year = $7.5/year.

Carlos needs to cover the initial planting cost of $90. To determine how many years it will take to cover this cost, we divide the planting cost by the yearly net profit:
$90 / $7.5/year = 12 years.

So, after 12 years, Carlos will start earning money on the lemon tree.

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house: (1/3)x
2. She sold 2 more to the red house: 2
3. Half of what was left, she sold at the orange house.

First, calculate the vacuum cleaners left after selling a third:
Remaining = x - (1/3)x = (2/3)x

Next, subtract the 2 she sold to the red house:
Remaining after red house = (2/3)x - 2

Half of what was left after the red house were sold at the orange house:
Remaining after orange house = 1/2 * ((2/3)x - 2)

Finally, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
((2/3)x - 2)/2 = 5

Solve for x:
(2/3)x - 2 = 10
(2/3)x = 12
x = 12 * (3/2)
x = 18

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.</reasoning>

First, determine how many calories remain from the daily target:
2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

Next, calculate the calories per serving:
250 calories per serving.

Determine how many servings you can have with the remaining 200 calories:
200 calories ÷ 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings.

Given that the 300g bag contains 5 servings, compute the grams per serving:
300g ÷ 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Finally, calculate the grams corresponding to 0.8 servings:
0.8 servings × 60g/serving = 48g.

First, calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday:
She wrote 2/5 more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, which is 2/5 of 5 (Monday's articles).
= 2/5 * 5
= 2 additional articles.
So, Tuesday's total articles = 5 (Monday's articles) + 2
= 7 articles.

Next, calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday:
She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
= 2 * 7 (Tuesday's articles)
= 14 articles.

Now, sum up the total number of articles over the three days:
Monday: 5
Tuesday: 7
Wednesday: 14
Total number of articles = 5 + 7 + 14
= 26 articles.

Finally, calculate the total hours spent writing these 26 articles:
Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write.
Total hours = 26 articles * 4 hours per article
= 104 hours.

John bought blue ties at $40 each, and he spent $200 on them. To find the number of blue ties, we divide $200 by $40, which gives us 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 times 5, equaling 10 red ties.

Given that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, each red tie costs $40 plus 50% of $40. Therefore, each red tie costs $40 + $20 = $60.

To find the total cost of the red ties, we multiply 10 red ties by $60 per red tie, giving us a total of $600.

Finally, to find the total amount John spent on ties, we add the costs of blue ties and red ties together. This is $200 for blue ties plus $600 for red ties, equaling $800.

Next, we determine the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 3/4 of 120 units. We multiply 120 by 3/4: (120 * 3)/4 = 90 units. 

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.

<reasoning>First, we determine Sylvie's initial monthly salary, which is $600. Since she gets a 10% increase after every year for employees reaching the 5-year mark, the calculation for her salary increase over three years can be expressed using the formula for compound interest: 

Final Salary = Initial Salary * (1 + rate)^number_of_years

The rate of increase is 10%, or 0.1, and the number of years is 3. Thus, her salary increase over three years is:

Final Salary = $600 * (1 + 0.1)^3

As we paint our picture, we combine these vivid strokes to fill our canvas with 88,000 spots of paint, representing the total number of copies sold. In mathematical terms, we can express this masterpiece as:
H + 10H = 88,000.

Combining our brushstrokes into a harmonious equation, we get:

Ted the T-Rex needs to calculate the total amount of potato salad based on the consumption of adults and children attending the picnic. He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad and a child will eat half of that, which is 5 lbs.

First, he calculates the total amount for the adults: 
20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs.

Next, he calculates the total amount for the children:
5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.

Finally, he adds these two amounts to get the total amount needed:
200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs.

First, we find out how many pets Marcia has by adding 2 to Cindy's pets. Since Cindy has 4 pets, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Next, we find the number of pets Jan has, which is three times the number of Marcia's pets. So, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets. Finally, we add up the pets of all three: Cindy's 4 pets, Marcia's 6 pets, and Jan's 18 pets. Thus, the total number of pets is 4 + 6 + 18.

First, we find Corey's age by noting that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Next, since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Finally, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so we subtract 5 years from Amy's age to find Jackson's age, which gives us: 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

<reasoning>Let's start with the information provided. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's time before the diet improvement. This means that Gerald's original time was:

38 + 2 = 40 seconds 

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and then subtract that value from the original time. First calculate 10% of 40:

10% of 40 = 40 * 0.10 = 4 seconds 

Subtract the 4 seconds from Gerald's original time:

40 - 4 = 36 seconds

Therefore, Gerald's new time after his diet improvement is 36 seconds.</reasoning>

Start by determining the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats will be 2 * 60 = 120 cats. 

Next, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats. Add the number of dogs and the number of cats:
60 dogs + 120 cats = 180 pets (dogs and cats).

The number of rabbit pets is given as twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Subtract 12 from the combined total:
180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Finally, calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of rabbits to the combined number of dogs and cats:

First, for the weekdays:
John drinks 4 glasses of water each weekday: at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed.
There are 5 weekdays in a week.
So the total number of glasses of water from weekdays is:
4 glasses/day × 5 days = 20 glasses

Now, for the weekends:
John drinks 3 glasses of water each weekend day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed).
There are 2 weekend days in a week.
So the total number of glasses from the weekend is:

First, determine how many hours Mark spent on the first test and how many questions he completed in that time. Given:
- Mark took the first test for 8 hours at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He would have completed 8 hours × 5 questions/hour = 40 questions.
- Therefore, questions he left incomplete on the first test = 75 total questions - 40 questions completed = 35 questions.

Next, determine how many hours Mark spent on the second test and how many questions he completed in that time. Given:
- Mark took the second test for 6 hours at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He would have completed 6 hours × 5 questions/hour = 30 questions.
- Therefore, questions he left incomplete on the second test = 100 total questions - 30 questions completed = 70 questions.

Finally, sum the incomplete questions from both tests:
- 35 incomplete questions (first test) + 70 incomplete questions (second test) = 105 incomplete questions.

<reasoning>To find out how many french fries Dave originally bought, we need to work backwards from the end of the story when five fries were left.

1. Ants took the last fry before the 5 left ones, meaning there were 6 fries before the ants took the last one.
2. A raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving 1/3 for the pigeons. If 6 fries are 1/3 of the original number left after the raccoon's meal, then the raccoon had 2 * 6 = 12 fries, meaning there were 6 + 12 = 18 fries before the raccoon's theft.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries which adds up to 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Before the pigeons ate, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries left.
4. The seagull ate half of what Dave had before it landed, meaning the seagull consumed 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Hence initially there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries left when Dave had eaten his share.
5. Dave ate 14 fries, so before he ate, there were 34 + 14 = 48 fries in total.

Conclusion: Dave originally bought 48 fries in the pack.</reasoning>

<reasoning>To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to first calculate the weekly total and then multiply it by the number of weeks. 

1. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. This gives him
3 classes/day * 1 hour/class = 3 hours per day.
Since there are 3 such days each week:
3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours/week.

2. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day. This gives him
2 classes/day * 2 hours/class = 4 hours per day.
Since there are 2 such days each week:
4 hours/day * 2 days/week = 8 hours/week.

3. Now, add the hours from both types of days to get the total weekly hours:
9 hours/week (MWF) + 8 hours/week (TTh) = 17 hours/week.

We need to convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet by dividing those lengths by 12 inches per foot. 1200 inches divided by 12 equals 100 feet, and 720 inches divided by 12 equals 60 feet.

First, let's denote Seth's age as S and Brooke's age as B. According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation S = 2B.

Next, it is given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. Thus, we can write the equation: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28. Simplifying this equation, we have S + B + 4 = 28, which reduces to S + B = 24.

We now have two equations:
1. S = 2B
2. S + B = 24.

Substituting equation 1 into equation 2, we get:
2B + B = 24,

Let's first determine the total time Billy spends on each potato by combining the peeling and cutting times. For peeling, it takes 1.5 minutes, which is equivalent to 90 seconds per potato. For cutting, it takes an additional 5 seconds per potato. Thus, the total time per potato is 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds.

Next, since Billy has 60 potatoes, we need to multiply the total time per potato by the number of potatoes. The total time in seconds for all 60 potatoes is 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds.

Finally, to convert this time into minutes, we divide the total seconds by 60 seconds per minute:

To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, let's first identify the total revenue. They sold each glass for $0.50, and each gallon produces 20 glasses. This means each gallon generates: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10. 

Next, we define their profit formula: 
Profit = Revenue - Cost. They made a profit of $25. Thus:
$25 = Revenue - Cost

From the revenue calculation, if 'g' represents the number of gallons, then:
Revenue = $10 * g

Now, factoring in the costs:
Cost = $3 * g (lemons) + $2 * g (sugar)
Cost = $5 * g

Thus,
$25 = $10 * g - $5 * g
$25 = $5 * g
Dividing both sides by $5 gives us:

<reasoning>First, we calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent by taking 1/4 of his salary: 6000 * 1/4 = 1500$. Next, we calculate the amount he spends on car fuel by taking 1/3 of his salary: 6000 * 1/3 = 2000$. Subtracting both expenses from his total salary, we find the remaining amount: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$. 

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity: 2500 * 1/2 = 1250$. 

After the donation, we find the remaining amount: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$. 

Subtracting the amounts for his daughter and wife (200$ + 700$), we get: 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350$.</reasoning>

First, we identify Bo's number of crabs, which is 40. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so we subtract 4 from 40, giving us 36. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so we add 10 to 36, giving us 46. To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add Bo's, Monic's, and Rani's number of crabs: 40 + 36 + 46.

First, let's determine the number of votes the winner received. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 votes in total, we calculate 3/4 of 80. 
(3/4) * 80 = 60 votes for the winner.

Next, to find the number of votes the loser received, we subtract the number of votes the winner got from the total number of votes: 
80 - 60 = 20 votes for the loser.

Step 1: Let the number of white carnations Sandra ordered be denoted as W.
Step 2: Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Thus, the number of red roses is 4 * W.
Step 3: Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations, so 5 * W = 200.
Step 4: Solving for W, W = 200 / 5, which gives W = 40.
Step 5: Therefore, the number of red roses Sandra ordered is 4 * W = 4 * 40 = 160.

Let's begin by setting up our variables: 
Let Jean's age be J, Mark's age be M, and Jan's age is 30.

Firstly, we know:
Jean is two years older than Mark.
Therefore, J = M + 2.

Two years ago, Mark's age was M - 2.
At that time Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
Half of Jan's age (Jan is 30) is 15.
So, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than 15:
M - 2 = 15 + 5,
which simplifies to:
M - 2 = 20,
so:
M = 22.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark:
J = M + 2,
and substituting from earlier:
J = 22 + 2 = 24.

<reasoning>To solve the problem, we need to find the total time taken by each team to complete the relay.

First, let's calculate the total time for the well-rounded team:
Each of the four runners takes 55 seconds, thus:
Total time = 55 seconds * 4 runners = 220 seconds

Now, let's calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team:
First runner's time = 60 seconds
Second runner's time = 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
Third runner's time = 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
Fourth runner's time = 54 - 3 = 51 seconds
Therefore, the total time for the less well-rounded team is:
Total time = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Finally, to determine how many seconds the faster team will win by:
Difference in total time = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds</reasoning>

<reasoning>Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. Each side has an equal probability of 1/6.

1. Rolling a number greater than 3 includes the numbers 4, 5, and 6.
   - This is 3 outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability therefore is 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.

2. Rolling two even numbers in a row:
   - The even numbers on the die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on each roll is 3/6 = 1/2.
   - The probability of rolling an even number followed by another even number is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 = 25%.

3. We need to find the difference in likelihood, expressed as a percentage.
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%.
   - The difference in likelihood is 50% - 25% = 25%.

Thus, it is 25% more likely that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.</reasoning>

<reasoning>1. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \). Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
2. Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total straw for the rats is \( 6 \times 3r = 18r \).
3. There are 10 cages of hamsters, with each hamster receiving 5 pieces of straw. Hence, the total straw for the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) pieces of straw.
4. The pen of rabbits receives 20 pieces of straw.
5. The total straw used is given to be 160 pieces. Thus, we set up the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]
6. Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]

<reasoning>To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to establish the cost, revenue, and profit structure. Let the number of bags be represented by x.

1. Calculate the cost per bag:
   Purchase cost per bag = $20
   Transportation cost per bag = $2
   Total cost per bag = $20 + $2 = $22

2. Calculate the total cost for x bags:
   Total cost = 22x

3. Calculate the revenue for x bags:
   Selling price per bag = $30
   Total revenue = 30x

4. Given the total profit is $400:
   Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   400 = 30x - 22x

5. Simplify the equation:
   400 = 8x
   x = 50

Hence, the trader sold 50 bags.</reasoning>

Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards:
3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month:
60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months:
(60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

To find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we sum up all the cards:
Initial cards: 20
First month: 60
Second month: 40
Third month: 200

Total = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

2. Therefore, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.
3. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.
4. Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays; hence, Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence (2 * 5 cents).
5. To find out how much Mark makes from Publisher A: 500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents.
6. To find out how much Mark makes from Publisher B: 500 sentences * 10 cents = 5000 cents.
