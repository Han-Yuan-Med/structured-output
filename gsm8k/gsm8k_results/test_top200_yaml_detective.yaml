- reasoning: 'Janet''s ducks lay a total of 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs each
    morning for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends every day.
    Therefore, the number of eggs she sells at the farmers'' market is obtained by
    subtracting the eggs she eats and the eggs she uses for muffins from the total
    number of eggs laid:


    Total eggs laid: 16

    Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3

    Eggs used for baking muffins: 4


    Remaining eggs to sell:

    16 - 3 - 4 = 9


    Janet sells each egg for $2, so the total amount she makes from selling these
    9 eggs is:

    to the given ratio 7:11.

    The sum of their ages is provided as 162.

    Therefore, we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162.

    Simplifying the equation, we get: 18x = 162.

    Solving for x, we get: x = 162 / 18, which simplifies to x = 9.

- reasoning: '"Firstly, we know that the volume of the tomatoes is halved when they
    are cooked into sauce. We need to determine the initial volume of the tomatoes
    before cooking.


    Let''s denote the final volume of the sauce as V_sauce. Given V_sauce = 32 ounces.

    According to the problem, the volume of tomatoes cooked is halved to get the sauce
    volume.

    Therefore, the initial volume of the tomatoes, V_initial, should be 2 times V_sauce.


    V_initial = 2 * V_sauce = 2 * 32 ounces = 64 ounces.


    Next, each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.

    We need to find out how many 16-ounce cans are required to get 64 ounces of tomatoes.


    Number of cans = V_initial / 16 ounces per can = 64 / 16 = 4 cans.


    Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we now calculate the total number of tomatoes.


    Number of tomatoes = Number of cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.


    Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes for her last batch of tomato sauce."

    chicken sausages, so:

    Number of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6

- reasoning: 'Let''s solve the problem step by step, like solving a mystery.


    1. Convert all measurements to the same unit: feet.


    - Each roll is 4 inches long. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \(\frac{4}{12}
    = \frac{1}{3}\) feet long.

    - Each croissant is 6 inches long. So, each croissant is \(\frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}\)
    feet long.

    - Each baguette is already given in feet, so it remains 2 feet long.


    2. Calculate the total length of each type of baked good if placed end to end:


    - For the rolls: \(300 \text{ rolls} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ feet/roll} = 100
    \text{ feet}\)

    - For the croissants: \(120 \text{ croissants} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ feet/croissant}
    = 60 \text{ feet}\)

    - For the baguettes: \(60 \text{ baguettes} \times 2 \text{ feet/baguette} = 120
    \text{ feet}\)


    3. Add up all the total lengths to get the final answer:


    - Total length = 100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes)

    - Total length = 280 feet

- reasoning: 'First, let''s determine the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater
    than 3 in a single roll of a six-sided die:

    - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.

    - There are 3 such numbers out of the 6 possible numbers.

    - Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which
    simplifies to 1/2 or 50%.


    Next, let''s calculate the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a
    row. On a six-sided die, the even numbers are 2, 4, and 6.

    - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll of a six-sided die
    is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%.

    - Since Jerry needs to roll two even numbers consecutively, we multiply the probabilities
    of these two independent events: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.


    Finally, we compare the two probabilities:

    - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%.

    - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%.

    - To express the difference as a percentage, we calculate 50% - 25% = 25%.


    Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3
    than that he will roll two even numbers in a row.

- reasoning: 'To find the number of rats per cage, we need to break down the problem
    into smaller steps:

    1. Define variables and total known amounts: Let R be the number of rats in each
    cage. There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is 3R.

    2. Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to rats is \(3R \times
    6 = 18R\).

    3. Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, and there are 10 hamsters in total, so
    the straw given to the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\).

    4. The rabbits get a total of 20 pieces of straw.

    5. The total pieces of straw distributed are 160. Therefore, the sum of the straw
    distributed to all rodents must equal 160.


    Set up the equation based on these facts:

    \(18R + 50 + 20 = 160\)


    Now, solve for R:

    18R + 50 + 20 = 160

    18R + 70 = 160

    18R = 160 - 70

    18R = 90

    R = \(\frac{90}{18}\)

    R = 5


    Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.

- reasoning: '"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the accumulated amount Mandy
    owes Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest of 2%.


    The formula for simple interest can be used here because the problem indicates
    a monthly interest rate is consistently applied:

    A = P(1 + rt),

    where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount (initial amount owed),
    r is the monthly interest rate (in decimal form), and t is the time period in
    months.


    Here, P = $100, r = 0.02 (2%), and t = 3 months. Plug these values into the formula:

    A = 100 * (1 + 0.02 * 3).


    First, calculate 0.02 * 3:

    0.02 * 3 = 0.06.


    Then, add 1 to this result:

    1 + 0.06 = 1.06.


    Finally, multiply this by the principal amount:

    100 * 1.06 = 106.


    Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106 after 3 months."

    $30, therefore, the total revenue from selling ''x'' bags is 30x dollars. To determine
    the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: 30x - 22x = 8x
    dollars. According to the problem, this profit amounts to $400. Hence, we have
    the equation 8x = 400. Solving for ''x'' involves dividing both sides of the equation
    by 8, yielding x = 400 / 8 = 50. Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags."
