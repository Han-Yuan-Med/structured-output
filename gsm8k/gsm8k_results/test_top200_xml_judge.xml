<reasoning>First, let's find the cost of one glass, which is $5. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3. So, the price structure is: first glass $5, second glass $3, third glass $5, fourth glass $3, and so on.

We can group the 16 glasses into 8 pairs since every second glass has a different price. In each pair, the cost is $5 + $3, which equals $8.

Since there are 8 pairs, we multiply the cost of one pair by the number of pairs:

$8 * 8 = $64

   - The initial value is $5,000.
   - The market will increase by 2.5%.
   - Increase in value = $5,000 * 2.5/100 = $125.
   - The new value of the jewelry = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.
   - Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.

2. For the electronic gadgets:
   - The initial value is $8,000.
   - The market will increase by 1.2%.
   - Increase in value = $8,000 * 1.2/100 = $96.
   - The new value of the electronic gadgets = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

Comparing the two profits:
- Jewelry profit = $125.
- Electronic gadgets profit = $96.

Since $125 &gt; $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

John buys 8 video games, each costing $20:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160.

John has $5 left after buying the video games:
$195 - $160 = $35 (the remaining amount after buying the games, including the $5 left over).

Thus, he didn't use all $195 gained from selling the lego sets, which means he actually used:
He bought video games worth $160 and had $5 left, so he actually had $160 + $5 = $165 used out of the $195.

To check how many lego sets worth is $165:

<reasoning>Candice originally had 80 post-it notes. She used 220 post-it notes at work. She was left with 23 post-it notes overall. 

Let x be the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased.

The equation to represent the total number of post-it notes used and remaining can be written as:
80 + x - 220 = 23

Solving for x:
80 + x - 220 = 23
80 + x = 243
x = 243 - 80
x = 163

Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased is 163.</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, we need to determine the number of blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40, and he spent $200 on them, he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. So, each red tie costs 40 * 1.5 = $60.

Thus, the total amount spent on red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

The total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and red ties, which is 200 + 600 = $800.</reasoning>

First, calculate the total number of units in the building. There are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units. 
Total units = 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

Next, find out how many units are occupied. 3/4 of the building is occupied.
Occupied units = 3/4 * 120 units = 90 units.

Finally, determine the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the occupied units from the total units.
Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units = 30 units.

<reasoning>Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. To find the weekly production, we multiply the daily output by 7 (days in a week):

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the weekly production by 12 to find the number of dozens:

1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen

Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. To find the weekly revenue, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

<reasoning>First, we determine the total weight which the truck and boxes together must not exceed: 5000 pounds. The weight of the empty truck and the driver is given as 3755 pounds. This means the weight allocated to the boxes is 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.

Given that each box weighs 15 pounds, the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry is the integer part of 1245 divided by 15.

1245 divided by 15 equals 83.

So, the truck can carry 83 boxes without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge.</reasoning>

<reasoning>To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries after adding the extra fees, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the 25% fee on the initial $40.00 bill.
2. Add the calculated 25% fee to the $40.00 bill.
3. Add the $3.00 delivery fee to the new total.
4. Add the $4.00 tip to the final amount.

Step 1: Calculate the 25% fee on $40.00.
25% of $40.00 = 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

Step 2: Add the $10.00 fee to the $40.00 bill.
$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Step 3: Add the $3.00 delivery fee.
$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Step 4: Add the $4.00 tip.

<reasoning>To find the average square footage of a level of the sandcastle, we need to determine the square footage of each level and then calculate their average.
The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16.
Each level below it will have double the square footage of the level above.

- 4th level: 16 square feet
- 3rd level: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet

First, calculate the total dog food needed for the first 180 days:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

Next, calculate the total dog food needed for the final 185 days:

  <reasoning>First, determine the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog and the number of dogs is 60, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120. 
Next, find the combined number of dogs and cats, which is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.
Then, determine the number of rabbits. Since the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.
Finally, find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats and rabbits: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, we know that Freda's final sauce volume is 32 ounces. Given that cooking tomatoes into sauce halves their volume, Freda must have started with double the final sauce volume of tomatoes. So, Freda started with 32 * 2 = 64 ounces of tomatoes volume to make 32 ounces of sauce. Next, each 16 ounce can contains 3 tomatoes. Thus, to find how many tomatoes are in 64 ounces, we divide 64 by 16 (number of ounces per can), resulting in 4 cans required. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we then multiply the number of cans by tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.</reasoning>

Wall thickness: 1 inch

Inner dimensions:
- Inner length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Inner width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Inner height: 4 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 2 inches

Inner volume of one box:

<reasoning>To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to add up the total amount of TV he watched for the entire week and compare it to the 7-hour total.

- Monday: 1-hour episode.
- Tuesday: 1-hour episode.
- Thursday: 1-hour episode + 30-minute show.
- Friday: Two 1-hour episodes.

Let's convert all viewing times to minutes (1 hour = 60 minutes):
- Monday: 60 minutes.
- Tuesday: 60 minutes.
- Thursday: 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.
- Friday: 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

Total in minutes for these days:
60 + 60 + 90 + 120 = 330 minutes.

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, which converts to 7 * 60 = 420 minutes.

The remaining minutes for Wednesday episodes:
420 minutes (total) - 330 minutes (other days) = 90 minutes.

90 minutes is equivalent to:
90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.</reasoning>

Let x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year. He intended to bake 2x cookies this year. However, he baked 15 more than that, resulting in 2x + 15 cookies.

He dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 2x + 15 - 5 cookies. According to the problem, after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies. So, we set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying this, we get:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide by 2:

x = 50

<reasoning>Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up the equation: 6 * (photographs Brittany's phone can hold) = 1800. Solving for the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, we get (photographs Brittany's phone can hold) = 1800 / 6 = 300.

The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. So, we set up the equation: 50 * (number of ducks in Jamal's photograph) = 300. Solving for the number of ducks, we get (number of ducks in Jamal's photograph) = 300 / 50 = 6.</reasoning>

<reasoning>Sasha originally bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each and five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each. The total cost for the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 10 = $100. The total cost for the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 5 = $80. Therefore, the total cost of all the boards is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices for lumber have gone up by 50%, the new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 + ($10 * 0.50) = $10 + $5 = $15 per board. The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 + ($16 * 0.50) = $16 + $8 = $24 per board.

If Sasha sells all the boards at the increased price, she will get $15 * 10 = $150 for the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards and $24 * 5 = $120 for the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards. Thus, the total amount she receives from selling all the boards is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the original total cost from the total selling price:
$270 (total selling price) - $180 (total original cost) = $90.

<reasoning>Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \). Given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, we can write Adrien's salary four years ago as \( 1.3L \).

We are told that Adrien earned $40000 four years ago:
\[ 1.3L = 40000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = 30769.23 \]

Lylah's salary four years ago was $30769.23.

Over the four years, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. Thus:
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

To calculate Lylah's salary four years later, we need more information about how her salary increased, but since it's not provided, we'll assume hers remained the same, which is a typical approach in problems where only one person's salary change is detailed.

Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were earning four years later is:
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} + \text{Lylah's salary} = 56000 + 30769.23 = 86769.23 \]</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, denote the number of blue gumballs as B and the number of pink gumballs as P. We are given that B = 12. According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. Therefore, we can write the equation P = 4B + 22. Substituting B = 12 into the equation gives us P = 4(12) + 22, which simplifies to P = 48 + 22, resulting in P = 70.</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, we identify the total number of cars, which is given as 20.
Out of these 20 cars, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual.
To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total:
20 - 12 (automatic) - 4 (manual) = 4 semi-automatic cars.
Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100:
(4 / 20) * 100 = 20%

<reasoning>First, let's denote the number of queens as Q. The number of baby bees is twice the number of queens, so baby bees = 2Q. The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, so worker bees = 2 * (2Q) = 4Q.

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700

Combining the terms, we get:
7Q = 700

Solving for Q by dividing both sides by 7:
Q = 700 / 7
Q = 100

Now, to find the number of worker bees, we multiply the number of queens by 4:
Worker bees = 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400</reasoning>

First, we need to calculate the amount of time each boy will take to get home. We will convert their distances from miles to feet (since their speeds are given in feet per minute), remembering that 1 mile equals 5280 feet.

Steve's distance from school is 3 miles: 
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Time for Steve to get home:
15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim's distance from school is 2 miles:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Time for Tim to get home:
10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Now, we see that Steve gets home in 36 minutes, whereas Tim gets home in 40 minutes. 

The difference in their travel times is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Thus, Steve will be waiting at home for 4 minutes before Tim finishes the race.

<reasoning>Let's start from the final number of fries left, which is 5. The ants carried off 1 french fry before that, so there were 6 fries before the ants. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries at that point, which means the 6 fries represented the remaining one-third. Thus, before the raccoon, there were 18 fries (since 18 / 3 = 6). 

The pigeons each ate 3 fries, totaling 9 fries. Adding these to the remaining 18 fries, there were 27 fries before pigeons ate. 

The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate, which means if Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull ate 7 fries. Adding these 21 fries (7 from seagull + 14 by Dave) to the remaining 27 fries, gives us a total of 48 fries. Thus, Dave originally had 48 fries in the pack before any were consumed or stolen.</reasoning>

Juan and Carlos sell lemonade for $0.50 per glass and get 20 glasses per gallon. Therefore, their revenue per gallon is \(20 \times 0.50 = 10\) dollars. 

Let \( g \) be the number of gallons they made. 

Their total revenue is \( 10g \), and they made $25 in profit. 

The cost to produce each gallon is \( 3 \) dollars for lemons and \( 2 \) dollars for sugar, resulting in a total cost of \( 5 \) dollars per gallon.

Thus, their profit equation, considering total revenue and total cost should be:

\[ 10g - 5g = 25 \]

Solving for \( g \):

\[ 5g = 25 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Therefore, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. 

The cost of lemons per gallon is $3. Therefore, the total cost spent on lemons is:

Team B's first runner takes 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Therefore, their times will be:
- 1st runner: 60 seconds
- 2nd runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- 3rd runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- 4th runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time taken by Team B will be:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

The difference in time between Team B and Team A will be:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

<reasoning>First, determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are three numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6), so the probability is 3/6 or 1/2, which is 50%.

Next, determine the probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die. There are three even numbers (2, 4, and 6), so the probability is 3/6 or 1/2, which is 50%. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, which is 25%.

The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row is 50% - 25% = 25%.</reasoning>

<reasoning>Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples. To find the number of apples Jenna picked, we divide the number of apples her mom picked by 2. So, Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the apples Jenna picked to the apples her mom picked. Therefore, the total number of apples they both picked is 20 + 10.</reasoning>

<reasoning>To determine the number of rats in each cage, first calculate the total straw given to the hamsters and rabbits. Then, subtract this from the total straw distributed (160 pieces) to find out how much straw was used for the rats. Finally, determine the number of rats per cage based on the given conditions.

1. Calculate straw given to the hamsters:
10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw.
2. Calculate straw given to the rabbits:
20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits.

3. Subtract the straw given to the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw:
160 pieces of straw (total) - 50 pieces of straw (hamsters) - 20 pieces of straw (rabbits) = 90 pieces of straw (rats).

4. Determine the number of rats:
Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. So:
90 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = 15 rats.

5. There are 3 cages of rats, and the total number of rats (15) must be evenly distributed among these cages:
15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.</reasoning>

Mandy owes $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which is 0.02 in decimal form. The formula to find the amount after n months with interest compounded monthly is: 
Amount = Principal * (1 + rate)^n
Here, Principal = $100, rate = 0.02, and n = 3. 
Using the formula:
Amount = 100 * (1 + 0.02)^3
= 100 * (1.02)^3
= 100 * 1.061208
= 106.1208
Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

Let x be the number of bags of wheat the trader bought.

The cost price per bag is $20, and the transportation cost per bag is $2, so the total cost per bag is: 
20 + 2 = $22.

Thus, the total cost for x bags is: 
22x.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling x bags is: 
30x.

The profit made is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost.
400 = 30x - 22x.
400 = 8x.

Now, solve for x:
x = 400 / 8.
x = 50.

First, we find the total cost of the tickets:
$20.25 for 3 tickets.

Next, we find the food cost, which is $4.50 less than the tickets:
$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the two rides at $33 each:
$33 * 2 = $66.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
$20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Finally, we divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each friend paid:
$102 ÷ 3 = $34.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees. Every year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, making a net increase of 8 trees per year. Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is 10 * 8 = 80 trees.
So, his total number of trees after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130 trees.
30% of the trees die after 10 years. Thus, the percentage of trees that die is 130 * 0.30 = 39 trees.
Therefore, the number of trees left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

<reasoning>First, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's yard on Friday. On Saturday, they took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos, painted them white, and replaced them in the yard. Hence, on Saturday, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos. On Sunday, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos. Thus, there were 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos on Sunday. Finally, the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos on Sunday is 30 - 6 = 24.</reasoning>

<reasoning>To find the number of children in Soda, we must subtract the number of men and women from the total population. The total population is 23786, and the combined number of men and women is 8417 + 9092. Therefore, 23786 - (8417 + 9092) will give us the number of children.

Step-by-step:
1. Add the number of men and women: 8417 + 9092 = 17509
2. Subtract the combined number of men and women from the total population: 23786 - 17509 = 6277

<reasoning>Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 20 * 3 = 60 cards. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Twice that number is 100 * 2 = 200 cards. Adding everything together, Elaine has 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards in total now.</reasoning>

<reasoning>Let the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A be \( x \). Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits \( x \) sentences for Publisher B. The total number of sentences edited each week is 1000, thus \( x + x = 1000 \), which simplifies to \( 2x = 1000 \) and therefore \( x = 500 \).

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so the earnings from Publisher A are \( 500 \times 5 = 2500 \) cents.

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, or \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cents per sentence, so the earnings from Publisher B are \( 500 \times 10 = 5000 \) cents.

To find the total earnings for the week, we add the earnings from both publishers: \( 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \) cents.</reasoning>
