Determine Dana's walking speed: Dana's walking speed is one-fourth her running speed, so walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.\n4. Calculate the time spent running and walking: Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds walking in a 6-hour period, so:\n   - Time running = 6 hours / 3 = 2 hours.\n   - Time walking = 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.\n5. Compute the distance traveled during each activity:\n   - Distance running = running speed * time running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.\n   - Distance walking = walking speed * time walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.\n6.

Unused carrots = 200 - 80 = 120 pounds", "answer": "120"}, {"reasoning": "Let's break it down like a recipe:\n\n1. Begin with the total population in the city of Soda: 23786 inhabitants.\n2. Next, account for the number of men: 8417 men.\n3. Then, account for the number of women: 9092 women.\n4. To find the number of children, subtract the sum of men and women from the total population.\n\nSo, we calculate:\n8417 (men) + 9092 (women) = 17509 (adults)\n\nTotal population - adults = number of children\n23786 - 17509 = 6277\n\nThus, there are 6277 kids in Soda.", "answer": "6277"}, {"reasoning": "Let's break this down step-by-step to find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has:\n\nStep 1: Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards. \nStep 2: In the first month, she collects three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.\nStep 3: In the second month, she collects 20 fewer than the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.\nStep 4: In the third month, she collects twice the number of the first and second month combined, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.\n\nNow, let's add up all the cards she has:\nInitial cards: 20\nFirst month: 60\nSecond month: 40\nThird month: 200\n\nTotal: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.\n\nTherefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokemon cards.", "answer": "320"}, {"reasoning": "Let's start by determining the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number for both publishers and the total is 1000 sentences, he must edit 500 sentences for each publisher.\n\nPublisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, the earnings from Publisher A would be:\n\n500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents.\n\nPublisher B pays twice the rate of Publisher A, which is 10 cents per sentence (twice 5 cents). For 500 sentences, the earnings from Publisher B would be:\n\n500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.\n\nTo find his total earnings for the week, we sum the amounts from both publishers:\n\n2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.\n\nTherefore, Mark makes a total of 7500 cents in a week.", "answer": "7500"}]
