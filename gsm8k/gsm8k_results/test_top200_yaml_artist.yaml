    1. Let x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

    2. Henry wants to bake twice as many as last year, so he plans to bake 2x cookies.

    3. However, he ends up baking 15 more than he planned, so he actually baked 2x
    + 15 cookies.

    4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left.

    5. Therefore, the equation we set up is (2x + 15) - 5 = 110.

    B = 12.

    The number of pink gumballs, P, is 22 more than four times the number of blue
    gumballs.


    To express this relationship mathematically, we use the equation:

    P = 4B + 22


    Substituting the value of B into the equation, we get:

    P = 4(12) + 22

    P = 48 + 22

    worker bees as baby bees).


    According to the problem, the total number of bees is 700. So:

- reasoning: 'First, let''s determine the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater
    than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.

    So, there are 3 numbers that are greater than 3 out of a total of 6 outcomes,
    giving us a probability of 3/6 or 1/2 (which is 50%).


    Next, let''s consider the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The
    even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.

    The probability of rolling an even number in one roll is 3/6 or 1/2 (50%).


    To get the probability of two independent events both happening (rolling two even
    numbers in a row), we multiply the probabilities:

    Probability of first even number = 1/2

    Probability of second even number = 1/2

    Combined probability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 (which is 25%).


    Now, we compare the two probabilities:

    - Rolling a number greater than 3 = 50%

    - Rolling two even numbers in a row = 25%


    To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to
    roll two even numbers in a row, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger
    one:

    50% - 25% = 25%
