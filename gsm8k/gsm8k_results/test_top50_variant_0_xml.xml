<reasoning>Carla’s hens produce 16 eggs daily. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake cookies each day, making the total number of eggs used daily as 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. Therefore, the number of leftover eggs she can sell at the market is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. At $2 per egg, her daily earnings are 9 eggs * $2 = $18.</reasoning>

First, we note that creating a robe requires 2 bolts of blue fabric and an amount of white fabric that is half of the blue fabric, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fabric.
Thus, the total number of bolts needed is the sum of the blue and white fabrics.
Therefore, 2 bolts of blue fabric + 1 bolt of white fabric = 3 bolts in total.

<reasoning>Josh bought the property for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on renovations, making his total investment $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. The renovations boosted the house's market value by 150%. Therefore, the new market value of the house is $80,000 * (1 + 1.5) = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000. Josh's profit is the new market value minus his total investment, so his total profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.</reasoning>

Therefore, the total cost for each pair of cups (which includes one full-priced and one discounted cup) is $5 + $3 = $8.

<reasoning>First, calculate how much of the file Carla has downloaded when she is 40% done: 200 GB * 0.40 = 80 GB. To download 80 GB at 2 GB per minute, Carla uses 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. Windows then initiates a restart which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla needs to download the entire 200 GB file again from the beginning. Downloading 200 GB at 2 GB per minute requires 200 / 2 = 100 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken is the initial 40 minutes + 20 minutes for restart + 100 minutes to download the file again. Summing these gives: 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.</reasoning>

<reasoning>Anna drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour. Thus, she travels a distance of 3 hours * 60 miles/hour = 180 miles.
She aims to return home within 4 hours. She spends the first 2 hours stuck in traffic, so she is not moving.
Then she drives at 30 miles per hour for 0.5 hours, traveling a distance of 0.5 hours * 30 miles/hour = 15 miles.
She then speeds up to 80 miles per hour for the remaining 1.5 hours of the 4-hour window.
During these 1.5 hours, she travels a distance of 1.5 hours * 80 miles/hour = 120 miles.
The total distance Anna travels in the 4-hour window is 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.
The initial distance from her house was 180 miles.
Therefore, the distance Anna still needs to cover is 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.</reasoning>

To determine the number of years required for Carlos to begin making a profit from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the yearly profit and then find when the total profit offsets the initial investment.

1. Calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
7 lemons * $1.50 per lemon = $10.50 per year

2. Subtract the annual expenses (watering and feeding):
$10.50 annual revenue - $3 annual expense = $7.50 annual profit

3. Calculate the number of years required to recover the initial investment of $90:
$90 initial investment / $7.50 annual profit = 12 years

Let x be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie originally had. She sold one-third of them to the Jenkins family, which is x/3. This leaves her with x - x/3 = (2x/3) vacuum cleaners. She then sold 2 more to the Smith family, leaving her with (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners. She sold half of the remaining ones to the Johnson family, which is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2). After all these transactions, she currently has 5 vacuum cleaners in her inventory. Hence, the equation becomes:

(2x/3 - 2) - (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = 5

First, simplify the equation inside the parenthesis:

(1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = x/3 - 1

So the equation becomes:

(2x/3 - 2) - (x/3 - 1) = 5

Combine the terms:

2x/3 - x/3 - 2 + 1 = 5

Simplify:

x/3 - 1 = 5

Add 1 to both sides:

x/3 = 6

Finally, multiply both sides by 3:

x = 18

The shop owner can calculate the final value of each investment option by applying the predicted percentage increases.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Percentage increase = 2.5%

Final value of jewelry = Initial value * (1 + Percentage increase/100)
                       = $5,000 * (1 + 2.5/100)
                       = $5,000 * 1.025
                       = $5,125

Profit from jewelry = Final value - Initial value
                    = $5,125 - $5,000
                    = $125

For the electronic devices:
Initial value = $8,000
Percentage increase = 1.2%

Final value of electronic devices = Initial value * (1 + Percentage increase/100)
                                  = $8,000 * (1 + 1.2/100)
                                  = $8,000 * 1.012
                                  = $8,096

Profit from electronic devices = Final value - Initial value
                               = $8,096 - $8,000
                               = $96

Comparing the profits, $125 (jewelry) is greater than $96 (electronic devices).

To find the speed Marissa must maintain for the remaining segment of the trail to achieve an average pace of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile route, we start by calculating:
1. The total time required to maintain the average pace: Total distance (12 miles) / Average pace (4 mph) = 12 / 4 = 3 hours.
2. The time she has already spent covering the initial 6 miles: 1 hour (for the first 4 miles) + 1 hour (for the next 2 miles) = 2 hours.
3. The remaining time to complete the route: Total time required (3 hours) - Time already spent (2 hours) = 1 hour.
4. The remaining distance to cover: Total distance (12 miles) - Distance already covered (6 miles) = 6 miles.
5. To cover the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 1 hour: Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

<reasoning>To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen owns, we start by defining the number of silver coins as \( S \). Given that she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be expressed as \( S + 30 \). Since she has a total of 110 coins, we can set up the equation:

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we obtain:

\[ 2S = 80 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

<reasoning>Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. Since her skipping rate is half her running speed, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour. Her walking speed is one-quarter of her running speed, so her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana allocates one-third of the six hours to running and the remaining two-thirds to walking. Thus, she runs for 2 hours and walks for 4 hours.

The distance she covers while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

<reasoning>First, determine the number of blue ties Sam bought. He spent $200 on blue ties, each priced at $40:
200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.
According to the ratio, for each blue tie, he buys two red ties:
5 blue ties * 2 red ties per blue tie = 10 red ties.
Next, calculate the cost of each red tie given the red ties are 50% more expensive than blue ties priced at $40:
40 + 0.5 * 40 = 60 per red tie.
Finally, calculate the total expenditure on red ties:
10 red ties * 60 per red tie = 600.
Add the total costs together for the blue and red ties:
200 (blue ties) + 600 (red ties) = 800.

Tracy had a wire of 4 feet in length. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the wire is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches long. Each segment of wire is 6 inches long. To find out how many segments she could cut from the wire, we need to divide the total length of the wire by the length of each segment: \(48 \div 6 = 8\).

First, we need to find the total number of apartments in the complex. 
There are 15 stories, each with 8 apartments:
15 stories × 8 apartments/story = 120 apartments.

Next, we calculate the number of occupied apartments:
75% of 120 apartments = 0.75 × 120 = 90 apartments.

Finally, we determine the number of vacant apartments by subtracting the occupied apartments from the total apartments:
120 apartments - 90 occupied apartments = 30 vacant apartments.
