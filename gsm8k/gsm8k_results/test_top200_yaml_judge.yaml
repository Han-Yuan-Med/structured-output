    From the problem, it is given:

    the inner dimensions of each box.


    Given the outer dimensions of each box as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches and
    the walls being 1 inch thick, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls twice
    for each dimension since the wall thickness affects both sides of each dimension.


    Therefore, the inner dimensions of each box are:

    - Length: 5 inches - 2 inches (1 inch on each side) = 3 inches

    - Width: 6 inches - 2 inches (1 inch on each side) = 4 inches

    - Height: 4 inches - 2 inches (1 inch on each side) = 2 inches


    Then, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula:

    Volume = Length * Width * Height

    Volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches


    Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

    Total inner volume = 3 * volume of one box

    Total inner volume = 3 * 24 cubic inches = 72 cubic inches

    1. Calculate the initial cost of the lumber she bought.

    2. Calculate the selling price of the lumber after the 50% price increase.

    3. Subtract the initial cost from the selling price to find the profit.


    Step 1: Calculate the initial cost

    - She bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: 10 boards * $10 = $100

    - She bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: 5 boards * $16 = $80

    - Total initial cost: $100 + $80 = $180


    Step 2: Calculate the selling price

    - The price has gone up by 50%, so the new price is 150% of the original price.

    - Selling price for the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards * $10 * 1.50 = $150

    - Selling price for the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $16 * 1.50 = $120

    relation between the number of pink gumballs and blue gumballs.


    Let P represent the number of pink gumballs, and let B represent the number of
    blue gumballs. According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the
    number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This relationship can be expressed
    as:

    P = 4B + 22


    We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs. Substituting B = 12 into the equation:

    P = 4(12) + 22

    P = 48 + 22

    P = 70


    Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

- reasoning: 'First, define the number of queens as \( Q \). Since there are twice
    as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \). Additionally,
    since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees
    is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \). The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of
    queens, baby bees, and worker bees. This can be expressed as:


    \( Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \)


    Simplify the equation:


    \( 7Q = 700 \)


    Divide both sides by 7:


    \( Q = 100 \)


    Since there are \( 4Q \) worker bees, substitute \( Q \) with 100:


    \( 4 \times 100 = 400 \)

    3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars.


    First, I will calculate the total cost before adding tax:

    Next, I need to determine which items are nonfood items: light bulbs, cups, and

    Let''s denote the number of rats as \( R \), the cages of rats as 3, and each

    Total straw used by rats = Number of rats (R) * 6 pieces of straw.


    Let''s denote the number of hamsters as \( H \), the cages of hamsters as 10,

    Total straw used by hamsters = Number of hamsters (H) * 5 pieces of straw.


    Straw used by rabbits = 20 pieces.


    According to the problem, the total straw used by all rodents is 160 pieces.

    So, the equation representing the distribution of straw becomes:

    (Number of rats * straw per rat) + (Number of hamsters * straw per hamster) +
    Straw for rabbits = 160

    or, (R * 6) + (H * 5) + 20 = 160


    Calculate total straw used by hamsters:

    Total straw used by hamsters = 10 * 5 = 50


    Now, calculate straw used by rabbits:
