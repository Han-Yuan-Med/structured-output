According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as: S = 2B. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so the second equation is: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28. Simplifying the second equation: S + B + 4 = 28. Substituting the first equation into the second: 2B + B + 4 = 28. This reduces to 3B + 4 = 28, and subtracting 4 from both sides gives 3B = 24. Dividing both sides by 3 gives B = 8.
