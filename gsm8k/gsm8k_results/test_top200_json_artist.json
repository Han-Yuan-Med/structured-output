According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can express this relationship as S = 2B. In 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years is given as 28: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28. Simplifying this equation, we get S + B + 4 = 28. Since we know S = 2B, we can substitute 2B for S in the equation: 2B + B + 4 = 28. Combining like terms: 3B + 4 = 28. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 3B = 24.

Since they made $25 in profit and each glass sells for $0.50, we need to find the number of glasses sold. The revenue is the profit plus the cost of producing the lemonade. The total cost per gallon is $3 for lemons plus $2 for sugar, so $5 per gallon. We can set up the equation: Revenue = Profit + Costs. For each gallon, revenue from selling 20 glasses at $0.50 per glass is 20 * 0.50 = $10. Let's denote the number of gallons produced as 'g'. Therefore, the total revenue (R) is R = 25 + 5g, and the revenue from selling the lemonade is also R = 20g * 0.50. Setting up the equation, 20g * 0.50 = 25 + 5g. Solving this, 10g = 25 + 5g, which simplifies to 5g = 25, yielding g = 5. Therefore, they made 5 gallons of lemonade.
