<reasoning>To find out the profit Josh makes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total initial investment Josh made. 
   Initial purchase price: $80,000
   Repair costs: $50,000
   Total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
   The increase in value is 150% of the initial investment.
   Increase in value = 150% of $130,000 = 1.5 * $130,000 = $195,000

3. Determine the new total value of the house by adding the increase in value to the initial investment.
   New value of house = Initial investment + Increase in value = $130,000 + $195,000 = $325,000

4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total initial investment from the new value of the house.
   Profit = New value of house - Total initial investment = $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000

So, Josh's profit is $195,000.</reasoning>

Wendi gives her flock a total of three meals a day. First, we know that in the morning she gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. Adding these two amounts together, we find the sum to be 40 cups of feed (15 + 25 = 40 cups).

Given that each chicken requires 3 cups of feed daily, and there are 20 chickens in the flock, the total daily amount of feed needed is: 

20 chickens * 3 cups of feed per chicken = 60 cups of feed needed per day.

By deducting the cups of feed already provided (40 cups) from the total required (60 cups), we get:

60 cups total - 40 cups given = 20 cups needed for the final meal.

<reasoning>The total file size to be downloaded is 200 GB. Carla can download at a speed of 2 GB/minute.

First, let's determine how much she downloads before the forced restart: 
40% of 200 GB = 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB.

The time taken to download 80 GB is:
80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

After 40 minutes of downloading, the restart happens, which takes 20 minutes.

After the restart, Carla must start the download over and download the full 200 GB again at the same speed of 2 GB/minute:
200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

Adding all these times together:
40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (full download) = 160 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Carla a total of 160 minutes to download the file.</reasoning>

<reasoning>John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph to his destination. The distance covered by John on his way to the destination is 
distance = speed * time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.

He then tries to return home in 4 hours but encounters traffic. He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic where he covers no distance. So, the distance covered during the traffic is 0 miles.

For the next half-hour, he drives at a speed of 30 mph: 
distance = speed * time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

John drives the remaining 1.5 hours of his 4-hour return trip at a speed of 80 mph: 
distance = speed * time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

The total distance he covers on his way back is:
0 miles (traffic) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

By the end of the 4-hour return trip, John has covered 135 miles out of the initial 180 miles, so the remaining distance from home is:
180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.</reasoning>

First, we calculate the downloads in the second month. The problem states that the second month’s downloads are three times the downloads in the first month. 
- First month downloads = 60
- Second month downloads = 3 * 60 = 180

Next, we calculate the downloads in the third month. The third month’s downloads are reduced by 30% from the second month.
- Reduction in third month = 30% of 180 = 0.30 * 180 = 54
- Third month downloads = 180 - 54 = 126

Finally, we sum the downloads over the three months to determine the total:
- Total downloads = 60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366

First, let's calculate the annual income from the lemons. Carlos will get 7 lemons each year, and each lemon sells for $1.5. Therefore, the annual income is:

7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year.

Next, let's calculate the annual costs of maintaining the tree. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. Therefore, the net annual profit is:

$10.5/year (income) - $3/year (cost) = $7.5/year.

Carlos invested $90 to plant the tree. To find out how many years it will take to recover this initial investment with the net annual profit of $7.5, we can set up the equation:

90 / 7.5 = 12.

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house:
    \[
    \text{Sold at green house} = \frac{x}{3}
    \]

2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house:
   - Vacuums left after green house and red house:
         \[
         \text{Number left before orange house} = x - \left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right) = x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2
         \]
   - Sold half of the remaining at the orange house:
         \[
         \text{Sold at orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
         \]

4. She then had 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \text{Number left} = \left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right) - \left(\frac{x}{3} - 1\right) = 5
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
    \left(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\right) - \left(\frac{x}{3} - 1\right) = 5
   \]
   Subtract inside the parenthesis:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 2 + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   Add 1 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6

   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   x = 18

To determine the profit for each option, we need to calculate the future value of the jewelry and the electronic gadgets and then find the difference from the initial value to determine the profit.

1. Calculate the future value of the jewelry:
Future value of jewelry = initial value * (1 + rate of increase)
= $5,000 * (1 + 0.025)
= $5,000 * 1.025
= $5,125

Profit from jewelry = future value - initial value
= $5,125 - $5,000
= $125

2. Calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:
Future value of electronic gadgets = initial value * (1 + rate of increase)
= $8,000 * (1 + 0.012)
= $8,000 * 1.012
= $8,096

Profit from electronic gadgets = future value - initial value
= $8,096 - $8,000
= $96

By comparing the profits:
$125 (from jewelry) &gt; $96 (from electronic gadgets)

So, the maximum profit will be from purchasing the jewelry, which is $125.

<reasoning>To determine the speed Marissa needs to maintain for the remaining distance to achieve her goal, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend to average 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.
2. Determine the time Marissa has already spent on the first 6 miles.
3. Calculate the remaining distance Marissa needs to hike.
4. Use the total desired time minus the time already spent to find the time she has left for the remaining distance.
5. Finally, compute the required speed for the remaining distance.

Step 1: Total desired time 
Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total desired time = Total distance / Desired average speed
                  = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
                  = 3 hours

Step 2: Time already spent
Marissa took 1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles.
Total time already spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Step 3: Remaining distance
Total distance - Distance already covered
= 12 miles - 6 miles
= 6 miles

Step 4: Remaining time
Total desired time - Time already spent
= 3 hours - 2 hours
= 1 hour

Step 5: Required speed
Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time

G + S = 110 

Also, "there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins," which means:

G = S + 30 

Now, we'll substitute the expression for G from the second equation (G = S + 30) into the first equation (G + S = 110):

Combine like terms:

2S + 30 = 110 

Next, subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with S:

He has $5 left, so $35 must be the money he had after selling the lego sets but we need to figure out where the inconsistency is. We can infer that John still holds some legos. 

Money from sold legos = Money from sold lego sets - Money from remaining legos.
Let's solve for remaining lego sets:
Total sales if all legos were sold = $195 -&gt; He has $35, sold total of = $35/15 sets. =2 lego sets remain.
Hence he must still have:
13 - 2 =11 lego sets remain.

<reasoning>John runs a total of 60 miles per week. Since he runs 3 days a week, we need to determine how many miles he runs each day. 

Day 1: John runs for 3 hours.
Day 2: He runs half as much as the first day which is 1.5 hours.
Day 3: He runs the same duration as the second day, which is 1.5 hours.

First, let's calculate his total running time:
Total running time = 3 hours (Day 1) + 1.5 hours (Day 2) + 1.5 hours (Day 3) = 6 hours

Now to find his speed in miles per hour, we divide the total miles by the total time:
Speed = Total miles / Total hours = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour</reasoning>

<reasoning>Dana's skipping speed is given as 3 miles per hour. Since this speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at 6 miles per hour. Since this speed is four times faster than her walking speed, her walking speed is 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of six hours running and two-thirds of six hours walking.
- Time spent running: 6 hours * 1/3 = 2 hours
- Time spent walking: 6 hours * 2/3 = 4 hours

Next, we calculate the distance traveled for each activity:
- Distance traveled running: 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
- Distance traveled walking: 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles

Adding the distances together, Dana's total travel distance is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.</reasoning>

First, calculate the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones initially put out. Since she baked 5 pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, we multiply 5 by 8 to get the initial number of pieces: 5 pies * 8 pieces/pie = 40 pieces.

Next, determine how many pieces were left after the guests had eaten, which is given as 14 pieces.

To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, subtract the number of remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces: 40 pieces (initial) - 14 pieces (remaining) = 26 pieces.

Therefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.

<reasoning>You have 200 calories left to consume (2000 - 1800). A 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, so each serving is 60g (300g / 5 servings). Since each serving has 250 calories, we need to determine how many grams can be consumed to yield 200 calories. 

First, we find out how many calories are in 1 gram of chips:
250 calories / 60 grams = 4.1667 calories per gram.

To find out how many grams you can eat for 200 calories:
200 calories / 4.1667 calories per gram ≈ 48 grams.

Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 5 * 2 = 10 red ties.
The cost of each red tie is 50% more than a blue tie. A blue tie costs $40, so a red tie costs $40 * 1.5 = $60 each.
The total cost for red ties is 10 red ties * $60 = $600.

First, calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books Uriah is removing:
30 comic books * 1/4 pound per comic book = 30/4 pounds = 7.5 pounds.
Next, calculate the remaining weight that needs to be removed:
15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds.
Now, determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove to shed the remaining weight:
Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can solve for the number of toys, x, using the equation:
(1/2) * x = 7.5.
Solving for x:
x = 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15.

Next, we need to figure out how many boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the additional weight of 1245 pounds. This is achieved by dividing the additional weight by the weight of one box:
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds per box}} = 83 \]

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial 24 liters:
\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

First, we start with Charlie's initial number of stickers, which is 10. Next, we add the 21 stickers he bought and the 23 stickers he received for his birthday. This sum is calculated as follows: 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers in total. 

Charlie then gave 9 stickers to his sister, reducing the total number of his stickers by 9. This subtraction step is: 54 - 9 = 45. 

Finally, Charlie used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card. We subtract this number from the remaining stickers: 45 - 28 = 17.

So, after all these transactions, Charlie is left with 17 stickers.

First, designate the number of games the team lost as L. Since they played 22 games altogether and they won 8 more games than they lost, we can denote the number of games they won as L + 8. Considering the total games played is the sum of both won and lost games, we formulate the equation:

L + (L + 8) = 22

By combining like terms, simplify the equation:

2L + 8 = 22

Next, isolate L by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

2L = 14

Then, divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know they lost 7 games, calculate the number of games they won by adding 8 to the number of lost games:

L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

2. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to adjust his 40-second time to reflect this improvement.
3. A 10% improvement indicates that Gerald will be running the race faster by 10% of his current time. 
4. Calculate 10% of 40 seconds: 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds.

- Thursday: 1-hour show + 30-minute show = 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours

However, he ends up baking 15 more than this, meaning he baked 2x + 15 cookies. Henry then dropped 5 cookies, so he has (2x + 15 - 5) cookies left. This simplifies to 2x + 10. We know from the problem statement that after dropping the cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110.

First, we determine the new prices for the boards after a 50% increase.

For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards originally costing $10 each:
New price per board = $10 + 50% of $10
  = $10 + $5
  = $15
Total selling price for ten boards = 10 boards * $15/board
  = $150

For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards originally costing $16 each:
New price per board = $16 + 50% of $16
  = $16 + $8
  = $24
Total selling price for five boards = 5 boards * $24/board
  = $120

Next, we determine the original cost Sasha paid for the boards:
Cost for ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board
  = $100
Cost for five 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board
  = $80
Total cost Sasha paid initially = $100 + $80
  = $180

Now we calculate the total selling price and profit:

First, let's denote the amount of sugar by 7x and the amount of water by 13x, where x is a common multiplier.
The sum of 7x and 13x should be equal to the total amount used, which is 120:

Combine like terms:

Solve for x by dividing both sides by 20:

To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, let's first calculate the number of vehicles delivered on the first day. The customs officer counted 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. This means the total number of vehicles from the first day's containers is 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day's import. Therefore, the number of vehicles that arrived on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.

Assuming that each container imported on the second day also contains 5 vehicles, we need to find out how many containers are required for 20 vehicles. Thus, we divide the number of vehicles by the number of vehicles per container: 20 / 5 = 4 containers.

Hence, 4 containers were imported on the second day.

<reasoning>Adrien's salary four years ago, as given, was $40000. Initially, Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, to find Lylah's salary, we set up the equation:

Adrien's initial salary = Lylah's initial salary + 30% of Lylah's initial salary
$40000 = Lylah's initial salary * (1 + 0.30)
$40000 = Lylah's initial salary * 1.30
Lylah's initial salary = $40000 / 1.30
Lylah's initial salary = $30769.23

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%:
New salary of Adrien = $40000 * 1.40
New salary of Adrien = $56000

Assuming Lylah's salary increased simultaneously and by an equivalent percentage, her new salary would be calculated similarly (assuming a 40% increase brings her to the same conditions stated like Adrien's):
New salary of Lylah = $30769.23 * 1.40
New salary of Lylah = $43076.92

Combining Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries four years later:
Total salary = New salary of Adrien + New salary of Lylah

<reasoning>Julia bought a number of new spoons and received 5 additional spoons from her husband. She used 3 spoons while making stew. After all of this, she had 12 spoons left for setting the table. To find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought, we start with the equation:

Total spoons after buying and using = Spoons bought by Julia + Spoons from her husband - Spoons used by Julia

Given that:
Total spoons = 12
Spoons from her husband = 5
Spoons used = 3

Let X be the number of spoons in the package Julia bought. The equation becomes:

12 = X + 5 - 3

Simplify:
12 = X + 2

Subtract 2 from both sides:
10 = X

Thus, there were 10 spoons in the package that Julia bought.</reasoning>

<reasoning>To determine the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we first need to find the individual costs of the watermelons and oranges based on the given cost of a pepper. 

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. Each watermelon costs three times the price of a pepper: 3 * $15 = $45.
3. Each orange costs $5 less than a watermelon: $45 - $5 = $40.

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of produce that Dillon is buying:
1. Total cost of 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180.
2. Total cost of 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300.
3. Total cost of 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400.

Finally, sum these individual totals to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, we need to calculate the total tickets used for the roller coaster. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. So, Pam used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets for the roller coaster. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. So, Fred used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets for the roller coaster. 

Next, we need to calculate the total tickets used for the luge. Both Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. Thus, each of them used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets for the luge.

To find the total tickets used by both of them, we add up all the tickets used. That is:
Pam: 12 tickets (roller coaster) + 12 tickets (luge) = 24 tickets
Fred: 24 tickets (roller coaster) + 12 tickets (luge) = 36 tickets

Finally, we find the sum of the tickets used by Pam and Fred: 24 tickets + 36 tickets = 60 tickets.</reasoning>

For the first test:
Mark had completed 5 questions per hour.
Mark had 8 hours to complete the test.
Therefore, he completed 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions.
Thus, the number of incomplete questions for the first test = 75 total questions - 40 completed questions = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test:
Mark had completed 5 questions per hour.
Mark had 6 hours to complete the test.
Therefore, he completed 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions.
Thus, the number of incomplete questions for the second test = 100 total questions - 30 completed questions = 70 questions incomplete.

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles of bleach required. Each client’s home needs 2 bottles of bleach. Therefore, the number of bottles required is 8 clients * 2 bottles per client = 16 bottles of bleach.

Now, let’s determine the total cost for the bottles of bleach. Each bottle costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the bottles of bleach is 16 bottles * $2 per bottle = $32.

Next, we compute the total number of packs of cloths required. Each client’s home needs one pack of cloths, so the number of packs required is 8 clients * 1 pack per client = 8 packs of cloths.

Now, let’s determine the total cost for the packs of cloths. Each pack costs $5. Therefore, the total cost for the packs of cloths is 8 packs * $5 per pack = $40.

Next, we compute the total expenses: $32 (cost of bleach) + $40 (cost of cloths) = $72.

Finally, we calculate Kim's profit, which is the difference between total income and total expenses. His total income each week is $92. Hence, the profit is $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20.

1. Calculate the total distance that Blake runs:
- Each back and forth on the 100-yard field equals 2 * 100 = 200 yards.
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Total distance run by Blake = 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

2. Calculate the total distance that Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs once back and forth on the 100-yard field.
- Distance for this part = 2 * 100 = 200 yards.
- Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which equals 2 * 40 = 80 yards.
- She repeats this 34 times.
- Distance for the 40-yard line runs = 34 * 80 = 2720 yards.
- Total distance run by Kelly = 200 (initial run) + 2720 (40-yard line runs) = 2920 yards.

<reasoning>First, we note the initial price of the bag of marbles is $20. The price increases by 20% every two months. We need to find the price after 36 months. 

1. Determine the number of 2-month periods in 36 months:
   Number of 2-month periods = 36 / 2 = 18

2. Calculate the new price of the marbles after each 2-month period:
   - Initial price = $20
   - Price after 1st period = $20 * 1.20 = $24
   - Price after 2nd period = $24 * 1.20 = $28.80
   - Price after 3rd period = $28.80 * 1.20 = $34.56
   - Continue this process up to 18 periods.

Using the formula for compound interest:
   Final Price = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18
                 = $20 * (1.20)^18

Using a calculator to compute:
   1.20^18 ≈ 27.8336
   Final Price = $20 * 27.8336 ≈ $556.67

<reasoning>First, calculate the total income Jackie will lose if she does her taxes herself. She will lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she makes $35/hour. So the lost income is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

Next, compare this lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

If Jackie hires the accountant, she avoids losing the $105 in income, but instead, she pays the accountant $90. The difference between the lost income and the accountant's fee gives the amount of money she saves: $105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.</reasoning>

    Let S be Seth's current age and B be Brooke's current age.
    According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke: 
    S = 2B.
    
    In 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. 
    The sum of their ages in 2 years will be:
    (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.
    
    Simplifying, we get:
    S + B + 4 = 28.
    
    Subtract 4 from both sides to find:
    S + B = 24.
    
    We already know that S = 2B. Substitute 2B for S in the equation:
    2B + B = 24.
    
    Combining like terms, we get:
    3B = 24.
    
    Divide both sides by 3 to isolate B:
    B = 8.
    
    Since S = 2B:
    S = 2 * 8.

<reasoning>First, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato. Since it takes 1 minute and 30 seconds per potato, we convert this time into seconds:
1 minute and 30 seconds = 1 * 60 + 30 = 60 + 30 = 90 seconds.
Next, we calculate the time it takes to cut one potato: 5 seconds.
Now, we find the total time to prep one potato by summing the time to peel and cut: 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds.
Billy has 60 potatoes to prep, so we multiply the time for one potato by 60:
95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds.
Finally, we convert the total time from seconds to minutes. As there are 60 seconds in a minute, we calculate:
5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes.
Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.</reasoning>

    To solve the problem step by step, we start by understanding the revenue and costs involved.

    1. Calculate total revenue:
       Each gallon makes 20 glasses. 
       Each glass is sold for $0.50.
       So, each gallon generates: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10 per gallon.
       
    2. Determine how many gallons they made and sold:
       Let's denote the number of gallons as G.
       Total revenue from G gallons is: 10 * G dollars.
    
    3. Since profit is $25, consider the costs:
       The cost to make each gallon = $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5 per gallon.
       Total cost for G gallons is: 5 * G dollars.

    4. Profit formula:
       Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
               = 10 * G - 5 * G
               = 5 * G dollars
       Given profit is $25, we set up the equation: 5 * G = $25
               Solving for G gives us: G = 25 / 5 = 5 gallons.
       
    5. Calculate the total spent on lemons:
       Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
       Number of gallons = 5
       Total cost spent on lemons = 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Rent = 6000 * (1/4) = $1500

Next, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel:
Car fuel = 6000 * (1/3) = $2000

Now, we calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel are deducted:
Remaining amount = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = $2500

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity:
Donation to charity = 2500 * (1/2) = $1250
Remaining amount after donation = 2500 - 1250 = $1250

Additionally, he gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700:
Amount given to daughter and wife = 200 + 700 = $900

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by each of the two teams and then find the difference in their times.

First, we calculate the total time for the well-rounded team:
Each runner in this team runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 runners: 
55 seconds/runner * 4 runners = 220 seconds.

Next, we calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team:
Their first runner runs the 400 meters in 60 seconds, the second runner runs 3 seconds faster (60 - 3 = 57 seconds), the third runner runs an additional 3 seconds faster (57 - 3 = 54 seconds), and the fourth runner runs an additional 3 seconds faster (54 - 3 = 51 seconds). Adding these times together:
60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds = 222 seconds.

Finally, we find the difference in time between the two teams:
222 seconds (less well-rounded team) - 220 seconds (well-rounded team) = 2 seconds.

Therefore, the well-rounded team wins by 2 seconds.

<reasoning>First, determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, which are 3 outcomes. Each side has an equal probability of 1/6. Hence, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2.

Next, determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6, which are 3 outcomes out of 6, so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 or 1/2. To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities of each event:
(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

To compare the probabilities, find the difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Finally, express this difference as a percentage. Since 1/4 is equivalent to 25%, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.</reasoning>
