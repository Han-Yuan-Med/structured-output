Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats across all cages is 3x, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. Thus, the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats is 3x * 6 = 18x.\n\n- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw and there are 10 cages with one hamster each, so the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.\n\n- The rabbits altogether get 20 pieces of straw.\n\nWe know the total pieces of straw distributed are 160, so we can write the equation:\n\n18x (straw for rats) + 50 (straw for hamsters) + 20 (straw for rabbits) = 160.\n\nLet's solve this equation step by step:\n1. Combine the constants: 50 + 20 = 70.\n2. Subtract this sum from 160: 160 - 70 = 90.\n3.
