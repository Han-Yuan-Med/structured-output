<reasoning>To solve the problem, we first identify how many bolts of blue fiber and white fiber are needed. 

- We need 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- We need half as many bolts of white fiber as blue fiber. Half of 2 bolts of blue fiber is 1 bolt of white fiber.
- We then add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together to get the total number of bolts.

<reasoning>First, calculate the total amount Josh invested:
$80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (renovation costs) = $130,000 (total investment).

Next, find the increased value of the house:
150% of $130,000 is calculated as 1.5 * $130,000 = $195,000.

Then, determine the new value of the house:
Total investment ($130,000) + Increased value ($195,000) = $325,000.

Finally, compute the profit by subtracting the total investment from the new value:
New value ($325,000) - Total investment ($130,000) = $195,000 (profit).</reasoning>

<reasoning>Miranda feeds her chickens in the morning and afternoon, but needs to meet a consistent daily total feed amount. The total feed given in the morning is 15 cups, and the afternoon feed is 25 cups. The combined feed amount for morning and afternoon is 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups. To determine how many cups Miranda needs to provide in the evening to meet the consistent daily total, we first calculate the daily total feed needed. Given the assumption that each of the 3 balanced cups is for the total daily feed per chicken, and there are 20 chickens, the total daily feed is 3 cups * 20 chickens = 60 cups. Therefore, the evening feed amount is the difference between the total daily feed and the morning plus afternoon feed: 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.</reasoning>

<reasoning>To determine the total expenditure, we start by calculating the price for every pair of glasses, as every second glass is at a discounted rate.

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.
- The total cost for each pair (one full price and one at a discount) is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we calculate how many pairs there are:
- 16 glasses / 2 glasses per pair = 8 pairs.

Now we multiply the cost per pair by the total number of pairs:
- $8 per pair * 8 pairs = $64.

Therefore, the total expenditure for 16 glasses is $64.</reasoning>

Mark initially travels for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour:
3 hours * 60 miles per hour = 180 miles.

He then reverses direction to return home, aiming for a 4-hour journey.

For the first 2 hours, he is completely stopped (0 miles traveled).

For the next 30 minutes (0.5 hours), he drives at 30 miles per hour:
0.5 hours * 30 miles per hour = 15 miles.

For the final 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 miles per hour:
1.5 hours * 80 miles per hour = 120 miles.

Sum of distances on the return journey:
0 miles (stopped) + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

Mark had traveled 180 miles away initially and managed to return 135 miles:
180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, he is 45 miles away from home at the conclusion of the return journey.

Carlos spends an initial amount of $90 to plant the lemon tree. Each year, he earns from selling lemons and incurs costs for watering and feeding. 

Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons * $1.50 = $10.50.
Annual expenses: $3.
Annual net profit: $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.

Carlos needs to recover his initial cost of $90. To find the number of years required to recover this cost, we use the formula for break-even time: Initial cost / Annual net profit.

Break-even time: $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.

<reasoning>Let's denote the initial number of gadgets Rebecca had as \(x\).

1. She sold one-third of her gadgets at the blue house, so she sold \(\frac{x}{3}\) gadgets there.
2. After selling one-third of her gadgets, she has \(x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}\) gadgets left.
3. She then sold 2 more gadgets at the yellow house, so she has \(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\) gadgets left.
4. Following this, she sold half of the remaining gadgets at the purple house, which is \(\frac{1}{2} (\frac{2x}{3} - 2)\).
    - This calculates to \(\frac{2x}{6} - 1\) which simplifies to \(\frac{x}{3} - 1\).
5. After selling half of the remaining gadgets at the purple house, she has the following number of gadgets left: 
    \((\frac{2x}{3} - 2) - (\frac{x}{3} - 1) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1\).

We are told Rebecca has 5 gadgets left: 
    \(\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5\).

To find the initial number of gadgets, solve for \(x\):

    \(\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5\)
    \(\frac{x}{3} = 6\)
    \(x = 18\).

   Running speed = 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

3. Walking speed is one-fourth of the running speed:

Number of articles on Wednesday = 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Next, we determine the total number of articles written over the three days:

Total number of articles = 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Each article takes 4 hours to write:

Total hours spent = 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

<reasoning>Candice started with 80 sticky notes and bought an additional pack with an unknown number of sticky notes, let's call this number X. Therefore, initially, she had (80 + X) sticky notes. During her shift, she used 220 sticky notes. After her shift, she had 23 sticky notes left. Hence, we can set up the equation:

80 + X - 220 = 23

Solving for X:
80 + X - 220 = 23
X - 140 = 23
X = 23 + 140
X = 163

Thus, the number of sticky notes in the pack she bought is 163.</reasoning>

<reasoning>First, determine the number of blue ties Jack bought. Each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties. Thus, the number of blue ties is $200 / $40 = 5.

Since Jack purchased double the number of red ties compared to blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The price of each red tie is 50% higher than the price of each blue tie. Thus, the price of each red tie is $40 + (0.50 * $40) = $40 + $20 = $60.

Now, calculate the total amount spent on red ties. He bought 10 red ties, each priced at $60. Therefore, the total cost for red ties is 10 * $60 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and red ties. So, the total amount is $200 + $600 = $800.</reasoning>

First, we convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, a 4-foot-long wire is 4 * 12 = 48 inches. Next, we divide the total length of the wire, which is 48 inches, by the length of each segment, which is 6 inches. This gives us 48 / 6, which equals 8.

<reasoning>First, determine the total number of apartments in the building by multiplying the number of levels by the number of apartments per level: 15 levels * 8 apartments per level = 120 apartments. Next, find the number of rented apartments by calculating 75% of the total apartments: 0.75 * 120 = 90 apartments rented. Finally, find the number of vacant apartments by subtracting the number of rented apartments from the total number of apartments: 120 - 90 = 30 apartments.</reasoning>
