<reasoning>Alice starts with a pink ball. After swapping with Gertrude, Alice has a green ball.
Fred starts with a blue ball. After swapping with Eve, Fred has a purple ball. After swapping with Gertrude, Fred has a green ball.
Since Fred has traded his ball twice and ends with Gertrude’s ball which was originally green, Gertrude now has Fred's original blue ball.
Bob starts with an orange ball. After swapping with Dave, Bob has a yellow ball.
Eve starts with a purple ball. After swapping with Fred, Eve has a blue ball. After swapping with Claire, Eve now has a red ball. After swapping with Dave, Eve has a yellow ball.
Claire starts with a red ball. After swapping with Eve, Claire has a blue ball. After swapping with Gertrude, Claire now has a green ball.
Dave starts with a yellow ball. After swapping with Bob, Dave has an orange ball. After swapping with Eve, Dave now has a red ball.
The final positions of each player’s ball according to swaps are:
