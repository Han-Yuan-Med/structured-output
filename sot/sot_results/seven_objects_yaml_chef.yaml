    3. Alice and Claire swap: Alice -> Red, Claire -> White

    4. Bob and Dave swap: Bob -> Purple, Dave -> Blue

    5. Fred and Eve swap: Fred -> Pink, Eve -> Black

    6. Gertrude and Fred swap: Gertrude -> Pink, Fred -> Brown

    Hence at the end of the game, the ball Eve is holding did not swap hands after
    the first swap where she traded her pink ball for the orange ball Gertrude initially
    had.
