<reasoning>Alice started with an orange ball. When Alice and Bob swapped, Alice got Bob’s purple ball. Then Alice swapped with Dave, getting Dave’s red ball. Next, Alice swapped with Eve, getting Eve’s green ball. Dave and Gertrude swapped, so Dave now has the pink ball (Gertrude's start), and Gertrude has the red ball (Dave's start). Alice then swapped with Claire, passing the green ball to Claire and getting the yellow ball. Fred and Bob swapped, so Fred now has the purple ball (Bob's initial), and Bob has the black ball (Fred’s initial). Finally, Alice and Gertrude swapped, so Alice gave the yellow ball to Gertrude and got the red ball from Gertrude.

<reasoning> We start by tracking Alice's ball trades:
1. Alice has a pink ball. She swaps with Gertrude, getting Gertrude's green ball. Now Alice has the green ball, and Gertrude has the pink ball.
2. Next, Eve and Fred swap. Eve (purple) and Fred (blue) now swap. So, Eve has the blue ball, and Fred has the purple ball.
3. Gertrude (pink) and Fred (purple) swap, so Gertrude gets the purple ball, and Fred gets the pink ball.
4. Claire (red) and Eve (blue) swap, so Claire gets the blue ball, and Eve gets the red ball.
5. Bob (orange) and Dave (yellow) swap. Bob gets the yellow ball, and Dave gets the orange ball.
6. Dave (orange) and Eve (red) swap, so Dave gets the red ball, and Eve gets the orange ball.
7. Finally, Gertrude (purple) and Claire (blue) swap, so Gertrude gets the blue ball, and Claire gets the purple ball.

Bob started with the orange ball and swapped with Dave, ending up with the yellow ball. Therefore, at the end of the game, Bob has the yellow ball.</reasoning>

We begin with the initial ball ownership:
- Alice: purple
- Bob: brown
- Claire: blue
- Dave: pink
- Eve: yellow
- Fred: white
- Gertrude: black

First, Alice and Eve swap balls:
- Alice: yellow
- Eve: purple

Next, Dave and Fred swap balls:
- Dave: white
- Fred: pink

Next, Alice and Gertrude swap balls:
- Alice: black
- Gertrude: yellow

Next, Fred and Claire swap balls:
- Fred: blue
- Claire: pink

Next, Bob and Fred swap balls:
- Bob: blue
- Fred: brown

Next, Gertrude and Bob swap balls:
- Gertrude: blue
- Bob: yellow

Finally, Gertrude and Claire swap balls:
- Gertrude: pink
- Claire: blue

Thus, at the end of the game, Fred has the brown ball.
