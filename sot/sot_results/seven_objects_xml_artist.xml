1. Initially, Gertrude has a blue ball and Alice has a purple ball.
2. Gertrude and Alice swap, so Gertrude now has the purple ball and Alice has the blue ball.
3. Fred and Bob swap, so Fred now has the pink ball and Bob has the green ball.
4. Fred and Claire swap, so Fred now has the orange ball and Claire has the pink ball.
5. Eve and Dave swap, so Eve now has the black ball and Dave has the brown ball.
6. Alice and Eve swap, so Alice now has the black ball and Eve has the blue ball.
7. Alice and Claire swap, so Alice now has the pink ball and Claire has the black ball.
8. Claire and Fred swap, so Claire now has the orange ball and Fred has the black ball.

Alice starts with an orange ball.
- First swap: Gertrude and Eve. Gertrude now has a red ball and Eve has a pink ball.

- Third swap: Fred and Eve. Fred gets Eve's pink ball, and Eve gets the black ball.
- Fourth swap: Alice and Gertrude. Alice gets Gertrude's red ball, and Gertrude gets the orange ball.
- Fifth swap: Gertrude and Claire. Gertrude gets Claire's blue ball, and Claire gets Gertrude's orange ball.
- Sixth swap: Gertrude and Dave. Gertrude gets Dave's brown ball, and Dave gets Gertrude's blue ball.
