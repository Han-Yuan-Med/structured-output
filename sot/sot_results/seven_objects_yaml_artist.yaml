    - Claire and Dave swap balls: Eve''s ball is still unaffected.

    - Dave and Alice swap balls: Eve''s ball is still unaffected.

    - Bob and Dave swap balls: Eve''s ball is still unaffected.

    Thus, at the end of the game, Eve has the orange ball.

  answer: orange
- reasoning: 'Initially, each player has the following ball:

    Alice - brown, Bob - black, Claire - red, Dave - yellow, Eve - pink, Fred - white,

  answer: purple
- reasoning: 'Let''s track the color of the ball Claire has through all the swaps:

    - Initially, Claire has a brown ball.

    - Fred and Alice swap balls (no effect on Claire).

    - Claire and Gertrude swap balls, so Claire has a green ball.

    - Bob and Dave swap balls (no effect on Claire).

    - Fourth swap: Eve and Fred swap balls, Claire''s ball (yellow) remains with Claire.

    - Fifth swap: Fred and Claire swap balls again. Now, Claire has Fred''s ball again,

    - Sixth swap: Alice and Bob swap balls, Claire''s ball (blue) remains with Claire.

  answer: pink
- reasoning: 'Let''s track Gertrude''s ball through each swap:

    - Initially, Gertrude has a pink ball.

    - Swaps with Eve: Gertrude gets a red ball and Eve gets a pink ball.

    - No effect on Gertrude in Fred and Bob swap.

    - Swaps with Fred: Gertrude gets a purple ball and Fred gets a red ball.

    - Swaps with Alice: Gertrude gets an orange ball and Alice gets a purple ball.

    - Swaps with Claire: Gertrude gets a blue ball and Claire gets an orange ball.

    - Swaps with Dave: Gertrude gets a brown ball and Dave gets a blue ball.

    - No effect on Gertrude in the final Alice and Bob swap.

    At the end of the game, Claire has the black ball.\n"
  answer: black
- reasoning: 'Initially, the balls are distributed as follows:

    - Alice: purple

    - Bob: green

    - Claire: pink

    - Dave: red

    - Eve: blue

    - Fred: white

    - Gertrude: black


    Step-by-step swapping:

    1. Eve and Dave swap: Eve has red, Dave has blue.

    2. Eve and Fred swap: Eve has white, Fred has red.

    3. Eve and Dave swap: Eve has blue, Dave has white.

    4. Eve and Alice swap: Eve has purple, Alice has blue.

    5. Bob and Alice swap: Bob has blue, Alice has green.

    6. Gertrude and Claire swap: Gertrude has pink, Claire has black.

    7. Alice and Dave swap: Alice has white, Dave has green.


    Therefore, by the end of swapping, Dave has the green ball.

  answer: green
