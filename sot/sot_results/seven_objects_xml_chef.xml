<reasoning>Alice starts with an orange ball and Eve starts with a yellow ball. After their swap, Alice has the yellow ball and Eve has the orange ball. Then Alice swaps the yellow ball with Claire's brown ball, so Alice ends up with a brown ball and Claire with a yellow ball. Next, Bob swaps his white ball with Claire's yellow ball, leaving Bob with a yellow ball and Claire with a white ball. Dave starts with a red ball and Gertrude with a green ball; after their swap, Dave has the green ball and Gertrude the red ball. Bob then swaps his yellow ball with Fred's black ball, so Bob has a black ball and Fred a yellow ball. Eve, who has an orange ball, swaps with Claire (who currently has a white ball), ending with Eve having a white ball and Claire an orange ball. Finally, Gertrude swaps her red ball with Dave's green ball again, so Gertrude has the green ball and Dave the red ball. Therefore, Fred ends the game with a yellow ball.</reasoning>

The next swap not involving Bob is between Dave and Gertrude. Alice then swaps again with Claire (irrelevant for Bob). The next relevant swap is Fred and Bob, who then swaps his orange ball for Fred's black ball. Finally, Alice and Gertrude swap their balls, which doesn't affect Bob.
