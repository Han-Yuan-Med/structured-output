<reasoning>Eve starts with a white ball. After swapping with Dave, she gets the pink ball. Then she swaps with Claire and gets the purple ball. Afterward, Claire swaps with Dave and acquires Eve's pink ball (so Eve's ball is the purple one). Then Bob and Fred swap, having no effect on Eve's ball. Fred swaps with Dave, again not affecting Eve's ball. Eve then swaps with Alice, getting Alice's green ball. Finally, Dave swaps with Gertrude, but again, this does not affect Eve's ball. So, Eve ends the game with a green ball.</reasoning>
